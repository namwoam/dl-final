19,110年學測-國文科第20題,B,"Translated Question: In the past, I jokingly said that professionals are like border collies, living off the monthly rations provided by their owners, while entrepreneurs are like wolves, who need blood to survive and cannot live without prey. Border collies' time belongs to their owners, so without an owner, their time has no value, while a wolf's time is their own. Selling limited time is the business model for salaried border collies. A wolf's perspective is different; they don't act alone because hunting relies on the wolf pack, so wolves learn to buy others' time to get things done. How is border collie's time valued? Prices usually come from value, and the value of ""to be"" (who you are) is much higher than the value of ""to do"" (what you do). For example, if you give a great presentation with beautiful slides, you might charge a thousand yuan per hour; if your content is very useful, you might charge ten thousand yuan per hour. But if a company is willing to pay a higher fee to have Li Qiang speak, it's not because of the beautiful slides or useful content – it's because Li Qiang is Li Qiang. Although a border collie with pedigree is more valuable than a homely dog, a dog that keeps learning and growing can become a wolf if the company undervalues its worth. Wolves don't rely on their owners' food once they leave, and they quickly become self-sufficient. (Adapted from Luo Hsien-Peng's ""Why Are Employees Mixed Breeds, and Wolves Entrepreneurs?"") The statement that best fits the perspective in the text is: (A) Entrepreneurs rely solely on their vision and do not need the education of professional managers (B) If a person becomes a brand, it is difficult to measure their value in the usual way (C) Wolves are aggressive, forcing border collies to exchange their time for a living (D) Dogs become wolves by leaving the company, and border collies stay in the business by enduring their time."

21,110年學測-國文科第22題,D,在新的電腦教室裡，日光燈照亮了每個本應陰暗的角落。我經過其他考生，大部分是孩子，他們的稚嫩臉龐隱藏著對繁華都市的無限想像。有一些長輩，看似不太適應電腦設備，但他們眼神中卻流露出溫柔的倔強。我按照監考人員的指示，坐入指定位置。 在這所歷史悠久的女校，現在肩負傳承臺灣千年傳統文化的神聖使命。我戶籍設在臺北市，但在這個歷史洪流中，我卻成了盲點。 「請檢查桌上貼紙，確認是你的位置。」我是否在正確的位置？ 在試場中，我被問及「妳從哪裡來？」、「妳什麼時候過年？」、「妳叫什麼名字？」等問題，但每次回答都無法得到尊重。 「Ciwas lalu mu.」我小心翼翼地托著麥克風，謹慎地咬字。Ciwas是我「真正」的名字──真正沒人稱呼的名字。 根據文章的脈絡，在考場中最合適的描述是： (C)闈場內依稀湧動著一縷篝火的熾焰氣味

25,110年學測-國文科第26題,B,甲: 一般人不瞭解文字和思想情感的密切關係，以為更改一兩個字不過是要文字順暢些或是漂亮些。其實更動了文字，就同時更動了思想情感，內容和形式是相隨而變的。例如韓愈在月夜裡聽賈島吟詩，有「鳥宿池邊樹，僧推月下門」兩句，韓愈建議「敲」字為佳。這段文字因緣傳為美談，於今要把咬文嚼字的意思說得好聽一點，都說「推敲」。古今人也都讚賞「敲」字比「推」字下得好，其實這不僅是文字上的分別，同時也是意境上的分別。 「推」固然顯得魯莽一點，但是它表示孤僧步月歸寺，門原來是他自己掩的，於今他「推」。他須自掩自推，足見寺裡只有他孤零零的一個和尚。在這冷寂的場合，他有興致出來步月，興盡而返，獨往獨來，自在無礙。他也自有一副胸襟氣度。「敲」就顯得他拘禮些，也就顯得寺裡有人應門。他彷彿是乘月夜訪友，自己不甘寂寞，那寺裡假如不是熱鬧場合，至少也有些溫暖的人情。比較起來，「敲」的空氣沒有「推」那麼冷寂。就上句「鳥宿池邊樹」來看，「推」似乎比「敲」要調和些。「推」可以無聲，「敲」就不免剝啄有聲，驚起了宿鳥，打破了岑寂，也似乎平添了攪擾。 所以我很疑
26,110年學測-國文科第27題,D,"甲: People generally do not understand the close relationship between text and emotional expression and think that changing one or two words is just to make the text smooth or beautiful. In fact, changing the text will also change the emotional expression, and content and form are mutually dependent. For example, in the story of Han Yu listening to Rongting reciting poetry at night, there are two lines: ""Birds nesting by the pool, monks pushing the month-lit door."" Han Yu suggests replacing ""pushing"" with ""knocking."" This anecdote, which has been passed down through the ages and become a famous anecdote, is said to make the text more beautiful today. In fact, the change is not just about the beauty of the words, but also about the atmosphere. The ""push"" certainly shows a certain wildness, but it indicates that the monk is alone, stepping out under the moon, returning to his secluded temple, and closing the door himself. There is a sense of self-sufficiency and freedom. The ""knock"" seems more formal and shows that there is someone to answer the door. It seems like the monk is stepping out at night to visit friends, unwilling to be alone, and there must be some warm human feelings in the temple. Compared to the ""knock,"" the atmosphere of the ""push"" is colder. Just from the line ""Birds nesting by the pool,"" the ""push"" seems more harmonious than the ""knock."" The ""push"" can be silent, while the ""knock"" cannot help but make a sound, disturbing the silence, and it seems to add some disturbance. So I am not sure whether Han Yu's modification is really as appropriate as it has been praised by people throughout history. Which kind of atmosphere is what Jiang Dai originally wanted to express in his heart can only be known by him himself. Is the use of ""push"" or ""knock"" more appropriate, the key lies in which kind of atmosphere is the one he wanted to express and was consistent with the entire poem. Textual analysis is actually emotional analysis. (Revised from Zhu Guangqian's <On Literature>) 乙: In Wang Fu-zhi's <Talking about Poetry>, it is said: ""The phrase'monk knocking on the moonlit door' is just an imaginative contemplation"
