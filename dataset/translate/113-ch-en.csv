5,113年學測-國文科第6題,D,"Translated Question: Where did the mysterious lozenge script, known as ""nüshu,"" secretly spread for over a century in Jiangyong, Hunan Province? It is a spoken language used script that is used to communicate and express feelings and knowledge through singing and understanding. Daughters in the family who were not allowed to ""run amok"" in the natal house were called ""tower girls"" in the natal house. Before marriage, they learned to recognize, write, and weave nüshu characters while singing, entering a knowledge system separate from the formal education system. When a daughter was married, each girl would give a book of nüshu as a memorial gift before leaving. The daughters would cry and express the shared fate of women who could not choose their own destiny. The natal house was a closed and intimate space for women, but it was also a symbol of impermanence. In the context of nüshu, women did not lose their ability to communicate and form alliances like other illiterate women after marriage. Through nüshu, they supported each other and found ways to survive in the face of social reality and hardship. The origin of nüshu remains a mystery, and it was only passed on in Jiangyong. As education became more widespread and traditional customs and social situations changed, nüshu gradually fell into disuse. However, research and application of nüshu are increasingly popular, especially in the consumer age, where it has become a fashion symbol often seen in cultural and creative design. (Redrafted from Zhao Zhici and Liu Waqiong's related research reports) About the relationship between nüshu and the ""natal house"" in the text, the most appropriate explanation is: (A) The natal house confines women's youth. (B) Women in the natal house share their feelings. (C) Women in the natal house long for a good marriage. (D) Women in the natal house are restrained by the marriage taboos and cannot return to their natal house."
6,113年學測-國文科第7題,C,"Translated Question: In the Jiangyong region of Hunan Province, a mysterious script called nüshu has secretly passed down for over a century. It is a phonetic alphabet using the local dialect and is used to communicate and express feelings through singing. Daughters in the natal home, who are not yet married, are known as ""tower ladies."" They learn to recognize, write, and embroider nüshu while singing as they learn. When a daughter is about to be married, the girls exchange written nüshu as a memento. The practice of crying at the wedding, which involves singing songs about the bitterness of parting, reflects the shared fate of women and their closed, intimate female space. However, it is also a symbol of impermanence. In the wedding songs, nüshu is often described as a taste of the uprooting of women from their native soil by the patriarchal society. This shows that crying at the wedding is not only a fear of an unknown fate, but also a howl of women cutting off their bloodlines and ties. Because of nüshu, however, after marriage, they are not as illiterate as other women and can still communicate and form alliances. The sisters' correspondence, although bitter, is always full of heartfelt advice and mutual support. Through nüshu, they struggle, wrestle, and compromise in the social reality, and even the scribe sometimes becomes a participant in the writing. The origin of nüshu is still a mystery. It was invented by women in Jiangyong and is the only script in the world using local dialects. However, due to regional barriers and the fact that it was mainly passed down through oral tradition, it was only passed down in Jiangyong. As more and more nüshu texts were burned as funerary offerings, along with the popularization of education, changes in traditional customs, and social context, nüshu gradually fell into disuse. However, research and application of nüshu are flourishing, especially in the consumer age, where it has become a fashion symbol and often appears in cultural and creative design.

7,113年學測-國文科第8題,B,"Translation Question: In the Jiangyong area of Hunan Province, a mysterious octagonal script called nüshu has been passed down for over a century. It is a phonetic logographic script using the local dialect and is used to communicate and express feelings, form sisterhood, offer prayers and blessings, and record news and stories. Nüshu played a crucial role in the lives of women in this typically agricultural society. Daughters who were not yet married were called ""tower ladies"" and learned nüshu while singing and weaving in their natal home. When a girl was about to be married, they would cry for her and give her a nüshu-related gift as a memento. The bridal chamber was a closed and intimate space for women, symbolizing ""impermanence."" The text often describes the bitter taste of marriage in a patriarchal society and the pain of cutting off blood, soil, and relationships. However, due to nüshu, after marriage, they did not lose the ability to communicate and form alliances like other illiterate women. Sisters' letters were full of hardships, but they always offered each other advice and support. Through nüshu, they struggled, grappled, and compromised in the face of social reality and hardships, and even the scribe sometimes became an author, lamenting and sympathizing while recording their own lives. The origin of nüshu remains a mystery. It was invented by women in Jiangyong and used the local dialect, but its spread was limited to the Jiangyong area due to geographical barriers. Most nüshu texts were burned as funeral offerings after the death of the woman, and as education became more widespread and traditional customs and social contexts changed, nüshu gradually fell into disuse. However, research and application of nüshu are increasingly popular, especially in the consumer era, where it has become a fashion symbol and often appears in cultural and creative design.

19,113年學測-國文科第20題,D,情緒訊號系統有一個特點，就是它總是「開啟」的。情緒開始時，幾乎會立刻出現訊號。例如，傷心時，眉毛內緣會向上拉，聲音會變得較輕柔低沉。最立即的情緒訊號是臉部表情。人們常將生氣、害怕、嫌惡、哀傷和輕蔑視為負面情緒，而驚訝和愉快是正面情緒。這個簡單的二分法有兩個問題：一是忽略了所謂的負面情緒並不總是讓人不舒服，例如很多人看了一部哀傷的電影後，喜歡大哭一場。二是將快樂視為正面情緒，但也可能很殘忍，例如嘲笑別人。唯有分析各種情緒事件的特性，才能分辨讓人愉快還是不愉快。 聲音是另一個情緒訊號系統，與臉部表情有很多有趣的差異。臉部是可以觀察的，而聲音則是時斷時續的，可以完全依靠意志力關閉。想隱藏表情，可能是人常以電話取代面對面溝通的原因。電子郵件甚至不需要說和聽，所以不會從聲音中流露情緒。身體動作也是情緒訊號：輕鬆時會出現放鬆身體的姿勢，輕蔑的動作是向下看對方，驚訝則是將注意力固定在產生情緒的對象。身體動作，像臉部和聲音的情緒訊號，雖然也是不由自主的，但控制身體動作比完全不露出臉部和聲音的情緒訊號要容易得多。（根據保羅・艾克曼《心理學家的面相術》）某些心理學家認為：情緒調整模式可以通過學習而來。以下最接近此觀點的是：(A)人爲七情，應物斯感，感物吟志，莫非自然。(B)真者，所以受於天也，自然不可易也。故聖人法天貴真，不拘於俗。(C)登山則情滿於山，觀海則意溢於海，我才之多少，將與風雲而並驅矣。(D)聖人所以治人七情，修十義，講信修睦，尚辭讓，去爭奪，舍禮何以治之。

23,113年學測-國文科第24題,B,在唐代，考試稱為知貢舉。因知貢舉者具有重大的選才權，因此舉子在考試前會向自己希望的考官投詩或獻文以博得青睞。一旦成功，舉子會感激終身，從而產生了“座主”和“門生”之分。柳宗元曾寫道：“假以時盼，各顯其功。號門生而不知恩之所自出者，非人也。”崔群的例子也反映了這個社會意識。崔群在中唐時期被譽為賢士，韓愈稱讚他“考之言行而無瑕尤”，但他對“座主”和“門生”關係，卻表現出了比較世俗的看法。《獨異志》中有個故事：崔群任相，名聲很響。元和年間，自中書舍人知貢舉，後人，李氏曾勸他買田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田田

Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners: Cinnabar for pharmaceutical use must be processed through the water-washing method multiple times, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. If done improperly using machinery, the heat generated by the machinery will cause cinnabar to become highly toxic, and it is extremely dangerous when taken as a medicine. My family became wealthy due to the cinnabar mining industry. Cinnabar should be processed differently depending on the quality of the raw materials and the purpose of processing. Water-washing: ◎ Only take the good sand, crush it into a fine powder, and put it in a jar with clear water. ◎ After three nights, the floating impurities are not fit for use, and they are poured into another jar. The settled and dried residue is known as head vermilion. Smelting: ◎ The bottom sand is not suitable for use, and it is placed in a furnace with water at the bottom and a pot on top. When the upper part is covered with a pot, the smoke rises upward, and the mercury flows downward. Vermilion has a cold and non-toxic nature, but when heated, it becomes hot and toxic, and it can kill people. Mercury is a highly toxic substance, and when cinnabar is heated under certain conditions, it produces a substance called silver vermilion. Some methods include adding salt, lime, or sulfur to make a light powder, or heating cinnabar to produce silver vermilion.
