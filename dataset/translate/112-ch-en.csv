7,112年學測-國文科第8題,A,"Translated Question: After years of effort by conservationists, Yellowstone National Park reintroduced 14 gray wolves in 1995. Upon entering the ecosystem, the wolves began preying on Canadian elk. In response, the elk population decreased and appeared less frequently in the valleys. As a result, the previously grazed plants in the valleys began to regrow vigorously, with some trees even growing up to five times faster. Environmentalist Montbieur noted these changes in a YouTube video and pointed out that the increased vegetation due to the decline in elk numbers made the rivers less prone to erosion. In 2010, a study found that although elk populations declined by 60% in a few years, trees did not grow rapidly and elk still foraged in areas where wolves were frequently present because the chances of encountering wolves in the vast Yellowstone Park were very low. Zoologist Middleton cited this study, suggesting that the impact of wolves on the Yellowstone ecosystem was significant but the drastic changes brought about by their absence could not be reversed in a short time. Ecologist Michaelchandler also pointed out that the decline in elk numbers allowed trees to grow, and predators like cougars and bears also contributed to the reduction in elk populations. Therefore, he believed that ""wolves change rivers."" Furthermore, Middleton acknowledged that this case raised awareness about the importance of carnivorous animals in ecosystems, but he stressed that providing accurate information was the responsibility of environmental scientists. (Adapted from ""Is the Wolf a Hero Who Changed American Nature?"") Among the given options, the most suitable sentence to insert is: (D) cannot be underestimated, and should be monitored as a warning signal."

9,112年學測-國文科第10題,C,"                            Translated Question: In 2020, the most anticipated astronomical event was the conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn. On December 21st, from Earth's perspective, the visual distance between these two stars was only about 6.5 arc minutes, making them appear almost fused together. Since Jupiter takes approximately 12 years to orbit the Sun, and Saturn takes about 29.5 years, they are only in conjunction about once every 20 years on average. Ancient Chinese astronomy referred to this event as ""the asteroid (Jupiter) encroaching on the celestial body (Saturn),"" but determining which planet encroaches upon the other is based on their relative velocities during their orbits. The ancient Chinese's method of observing celestial bodies was different from modern astronomy. For example, they would record the position of a celestial body as it moved in relation to another, and they would use the term ""yin"" to describe when one celestial body appeared to be moving more quickly than the other. The concept of ""yin"" was used to determine which planet was encroaching upon the other. However, this method was not always accurate, and there were many discrepancies in the records. Some of the key astronomical knowledge that was not assumed in the text includes: (A) Mars moves faster than Saturn in its orbit around the Sun. (B) Angular measurements are used to measure angles, with one degree equal to 60 arc minutes. (C) The Zhou dynasty's observational errors were smaller than those of the Song and Yuan dynasties. (D) The distance between Jupiter, Saturn, and the Sun is greater than the distance between Earth and the Sun."

11,112年學測-國文科第12題,A,2020年壓軸的天文現象是木星合土星。從地球看，兩顆星在12月21日的視覺距離僅約6.5角分，幾乎黏在一起。由於木星繞太陽一周將近12年，土星則要29.5年，因此平均約20年才會兩星相合。古人稱一個運動中的天體逼近另一天體曰「犯」，所以史書記載這兩星相合為「歲星（木星）犯填星（土星）」。但哪顆星犯哪顆星，是如何判斷呢？以公轉速度而言，木星比土星跑得快。但因地球軌道短於外側行星的軌道，所以從地球上看這兩星的運動，會發生順行（如A1→A2）、逆行（如A2→A3）的變化。而當木星在順逆行轉換、看似靜止不動時（古人稱為「留」），視覺上便可能土星快於木星。例如西元828年11月5日到21日，明顯是木星順行衝向土星，但21到25日，卻是土星以反方向接近木星，跑了2.2角分，但順行的木星只跑了1角分。以現代天文學看，木星每天頂多移動0.2度，小於宋元之際觀測誤差，約等於清代觀測誤差。如果真要依據這五天的變化寫誰犯誰，古人恐怕辦不到。古代「填星犯某星」的記載很少，《明實錄》的「填星犯太白（金星）」，到正史中改為「太白犯填星」。又彙整唐代之前國運占星術的《開元占經》，雖有「歲星犯太白」的占辭，但史書向來寫「太白犯歲星」。故可確定快慢印象是判斷誰犯誰的依據。（歐陽亮〈都是星星惹的禍？木星合土星─歲星犯填星〉）上文若要介紹「古人如何從木星合土星占驗未來」，並援引下列史事，印證《開元占經》收錄的某項預言，則此預言最可能是： (A)填星與歲星合，相犯為內亂 (B)填星所在，歲星從之，伐者利 (C)填

22,112年學測-國文科第23題,B,"甲: According to the Zhuang people, betel nut can dispel miasma, and Zhou Dynasty poet Ouyang Xiu indulged in it while traveling in the south. He sweated profusely and turned red in the face after consuming it. He even wrote a poem praising betel nut: ""It can dispel miasma and warm like incense."" Southern Song dynasty writer Lu Daijun also described his experience with betel nut in his work ""Shi Lao Dao Da"": ""People on the road seem like sheep, chewing on leaves and eating all day long. The way they eat betel nut can be said to be complete."" He also described how repulsive it looked when people had black teeth and red lips, and how annoying it was when many people gathered, with red stains everywhere. (Adapted from Xiaoyaang Xu's ""Reading Betel Nut with Ouyang Xiu"") Beta palms are native to Malaysia and the name comes from the Malay language ""pinang."" Betel nuts from Taiwan have high quality and have been used not only for daily consumption, but also for entertaining guests. In his work ""Shi Lao Dao Da,"" Zhang Gongzong wrote: ""People said that on the road, there were many people who seemed like sheep, chewing on leaves and eating all day long. The way they ate betel nuts can be said to be complete."" He also described how repulsive it looked when people had black teeth and red lips, and how annoying it was when many people gathered, with red stains everywhere. (Adapted from Xiaoyaang Xu's ""Reading Betel Nut with Ouyang Xiu"") Betel nuts contain polyphenolic compounds, areca nut, and areca alkaloids, which can affect the brain, sympathetic nervous system, and parasympathetic nervous system, increasing alertness and stimulating adrenaline secretion. The World Health Organization has confirmed that betel nut alkaloids have potential carcinogenic effects, and the lime added to betel nuts can damage the epithelial cells of the oral mucosa, leading to cell proliferation and transformation.

Ingratiating himself to the local customs, Su Dongpo enjoyed chewing betel nut greatly, sweating profusely and turning face red like drunkenness. He even wrote a poem to praise betel nut: ""It can dispel miasma and warm like incense."" During the Tong Dynasty, Lu Daijing in the《Shi Lin Yin Liu》 wrote that when he first arrived in the South, he declined betel nut, but after a while, he began to try it cautiously. After living there for more than a year, he couldn't do without it. Zhou Qunxi also wrote in the《Opposite of the Hills》: ""There is a saying that people on the road look like sheep. This describes the way of chewing with areca nut leaves, eating all day long. The form of chewing betel nut is described very vividly. Whenever they met, their teeth were black and red; when several people gathered, their teeth were red all over the place, which is really disgusting."" Beta: Betel nut originated from Malaysia and its name comes from the Malay language ""pinang."" In Taiwan, betel nut was not only used for daily chewing but also for entertaining guests. Li Zhiye, the author of《Ben Cao Gang Mu)>, said: ""People in the South use betel nut as a substitute for tea to dispel miasma. Its functions include: 1) It can make you sleepy when you're sober, making your cheeks flushed and red, like after drinking. 2) It can make you sober when you're drunk. 3) It can make you full when you're hungry. 4) It can make you hungry when you're full.

27,112年學測-國文科第28題,BCD,"Translated Question: Regarding the viewpoint on ""secrets,"" the following statement applies: When secrets appear in close personal relationships, everyone feels uneasy - I concealed the last and possibly the most important clue, preventing you from smoothly reading my entire file. The pain of love is how devastating it is! This world encourages honesty, as if only being open would allow mutual understanding, embracing, and crying in tears to make up. But secrets stubbornly broke the rational framework and made people aware of the limitations of human understanding language, discovering that loneliness is each person's true life theme. Fearing loneliness, people pretended to have no secrets to win imagined friendship. Sharing secrets is a bonding ritual among friends, but we don't share our own secrets. Telling other people's secrets is a cheap trick and a diversion. When everyone is busy telling each other's secrets, their own secrets are safe from being probed. The reason for some secrets to come to light is to hide another person's secret. (Revised from Hu Xingru's ""Secrets"") (A) Humanity's darkness is due to secretly telling each other's secrets (B) Exchanging secrets reveal people's need to ward off loneliness by mutual consolation (C) Telling other people's secrets satisfies curiosity and hides one's own secrets (D) Maintaining secrets and refusing to let others fully access them reflects loneliness as a life theme (E) The existence of secrets is due to the limitations of language, which hinders the intimacy of interpersonal relationships."

Those who affirm Cao believe that Cao's commentary on the Confucian classics is a classic, and they believe that Cao is similar to the Classic of Poetry in that it ""complains about gossip without causing chaos"" and can contend with the sun and moon.
