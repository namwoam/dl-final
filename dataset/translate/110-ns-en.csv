25,110年學測-自然科第37題,C,"Translated Question: In order to maintain life and perform various tasks, the human body needs to consume food and obtain oxygen from the atmosphere to provide energy and regulate the rate of heat dissipation, maintaining a normal body temperature. The human body can be considered as a system that interacts with the surrounding environment through metabolism, converting and storing energy (called internal energy) and exchanging work and heat with the environment. If in a time period t, someone performs activities such as cycling and lifting objects, doing work W, and the net heat energy released by the body is Q, then according to the energy conservation law, the change in internal energy U will obey the following relationship: -U = Q + W. Dividing both sides by t gives a relationship between the rate of change of the various quantities; generally, -U/t is called the person's metabolic rate in that time period. The minimum metabolic rate required to maintain basic bodily functions (including body temperature) is called basal metabolic rate. On average, for each kilogram of body mass, the basal metabolic rate is about 1.0 watt. The energy required to maintain human metabolism comes from the chemical reactions that occur when food is digested and combined with oxygen. For example, the process of converting glucose (C6H12O6) into the energy needed by the body can be simply summarized as follows: C6H12O6 + 6O2 -> 6CO2 + 6H2O. The energy released per gram of glucose in this reaction is approximately 16 kilojoules, which is often referred to as the energy per unit mass of the calorie.
