Data One: Farmers in Pingtung County who grow adzuki beans used to prevent bird damage and reduce crop losses by using poison to kill small birds, which in turn caused eagles to poison. Recently, to protect the environment, farmers have changed their farming methods, not poisoning birds during planting periods and not using leaf insecticides during harvesting. This new agricultural approach has established the ""Eagle Adzuki"" brand and traceability system. Although the cost of producing adzuki beans has increased, it has effectively improved the consumer's perception of the product, significantly increasing market sales prices and quantities. The main contract farming area for ""Eagle Adzuki"" is in Haidong and Wandan, Pingtung County.
