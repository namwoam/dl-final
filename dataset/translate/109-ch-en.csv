Although the names of the divisions vary slightly between past and present, the main sections of the day are: dawn, great harvest, great meal, midday, dusk, light meal, or dusk / nightfall. The fixed points are named after the position of the sun in the sky. This habit continued until the Han Dynasty or later. The time when the sun first rises from the horizon is called ""dawn."" The character ""dawn"" in the oracle bones of the Merchant Dynasty is shaped like the sun rising above something. Compared with the shape of the gold text, it may represent the scene of the sun rising from the sea, and it has not yet completely separated from the water; or it represents the scene of the sun shining on the water. The people of the Merchant Dynasty were originally from the east, so they would not be unfamiliar with the sea landscape in the morning. The next stage is ""great harvest."" The character ""harvest"" in the oracle bones of the Merchant Dynasty is shaped like hands picking fruits and leaves from trees. ""Harvest"" is borrowed to mean radiance, and ""great harvest"" is the time when the sun is shining brightly, which means that the sun has risen high in the sky and the vision is clear. It is the time to have a big meal to replenish the physical strength consumed by early morning labor in the field. Then comes ""midday"" or ""middle of the day,"" which is the time when the sun is directly overhead. Shortly after is ""dusk."" At this time, the sun is setting, and the light is fading, so it is called ""sunset."" After eating, the utensils are tidied up, and the sun is setting and the radiance is diminishing, leaving only a faint light in the sky. This period is called ""small harvest"" or ""no,"" and the character ""no"" in the oracle bones of the Merchant Dynasty is shaped like the sun sinking into the forest, with the light passing through the gaps in the forest. The character ""no"" later became a negation word and was combined with the day to form the character ""night."" (Adapted from Hsu"
