22,111年學測-國文科第23題,C,"Translated Question: In the Analects of Confucius, it is said: ""A gentleman has three fears: fearing heaven, fearing the greater number of people, and fearing the words of sages."" Zhu Xi's explanation: ○1 ""Greater number of people"" refers to those who hold high positions, wealth, and dignity. ○2 Fearing heaven means understanding the mandate of heaven and being cautious in one's actions. If one does not follow the rules of propriety, it is considered disrespectful to heaven. ○3 The key is to understand the mandate of heaven and act accordingly without daring to disobey. In the Book of Mencius, it is said: ""To respect a superior person, one should not look down on him, nor should one look at his imposing appearance. I have achieved my goals, and I will not serve food on the altar of sacrifice, nor will I have hundreds of wives and concubines. I have no fear of being on the side of the enemy."" Zhu Xi's explanation: ○1 This passage describes how some people value the high status and wealth that come with being a superior person but do not acknowledge the mandate of heaven. ○2 The phrase ""disrespecting superior persons"" in the Analects refers to not treating them with the respect they deserve, not by looking down on them, but by not respecting their imposing presence."
