There were many expensive music halls in Ximending and Daan District at the time. However, some songs were later banned by the government because they were too realistic and could undermine public sentiment. In the 1950s, the Executive Yuan formulated the ""Regulations for the Management of News, Magazines, and Books during the Martial Law Period in Taiwan Province"" under the Martial Law Act, and began to control popular culture, mainly by the Military Security Administration. For example, The Beatles' song ""Revolution"" was banned because ""the content is inappropriate, confusing, and endangering social order.""
