The population consisted of European whites, indigenous people, black slaves, and multiracial people, known as ""free people of color,"" who could also own property, receive an education, and have mixed-race relationships. The French Revolution and the Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen led to the recognition of these people as French citizens. However, their citizenship status did not immediately change. European planters opposed governing the territory based on the principle of equal citizenship and sought to establish an autonomous government. In 1791, an uprising by slaves occurred, and the French government was concerned that the unrest would benefit the counter-revolutionaries or other nations. To secure support for the revolution, they declared the ""free people of color"" as French citizens. However, the French government later realized that without the support of the slaves, they could not control the inter-ethnic conflicts in the region. In 1793, they freed the slaves and declared them citizens. The region continued to struggle for independence and eventually gained independence in 1804. However, recognition by the majority of countries was not granted until the mid-19th century.
