23,112年學測-自然科第45題,C,"Translated Question: Milk sugar and casein are important components for making cheese from milk. By adding specific microorganisms to milk and letting it ferment, lactose is converted into lactic acid. During this process, factors such as temperature, aging time, and other trace additives (such as salt) affect the texture and taste of the cheese. As the lactic acid concentration increases during the fermentation process, casein gradually coagulates and forms the solid component of cheese. The remaining protein in the solution is called whey protein, which is processed into high-protein nutritional products. The pH of commercial milk is 6.6, and the coagulation process of cheese begins at pH 5.3. What is the change in hydrogen ion concentration needed for cheese to start coagulating? (log2 = 0.30) (A) increases about 1.3 times (B) increases about 13% (C) increases about 20 times (D) decreases about 10 times (E) decreases about 10%)"
