(乙) Confucius' leadership style was characterized by his virtues of ""yuan"" (modesty) and ""gi"" (shyness), which contributed to the prosperity of his country.

Explanation:                           The mysterious lozenge script ""nüshu"" was secretly spread in Jiangyong, Hunan Province, and was used by daughters in the family who were not allowed to ""run amok"" in the natal house. They learned to recognize, write, and weave nüshu characters while singing, expressing feelings and knowledge. Before marriage, they would give a book of nüshu as a memorial gift, and daughters would cry and express shared fate. The natal house was a closed and intimate space for women, where they shared their feelings and experiences through nüshu."
6,113年學測-國文科第7題,C,0.0,B,"                           correct answer: (B) the bitterness of parting                           Explanation:                           The question refers to the practice of crying at the wedding in the Jiangyong region of Hunan Province. In this context, the daughters of the bride sing songs about the bitterness of parting, reflecting the shared fate of women and their closed, intimate female space. This emotional expression serves as a symbol of impermanence and captures the feelings of women cutting off their bloodlines and ties as they marry into a new family."
7,113年學測-國文科第8題,B,0.0,A,"                           correct answer: (A) The passage says, ""When I divide?""                           Explanation: The passage does not mention a nüshu work titled ""When I divide?"". The text discusses the bitterness of marriage and the pain of cutting off blood, soil, and relationships, but it does not specifically mention a work called ""When I divide?"". Therefore, option (A) is the correct answer as it is not mentioned in the passage."
8,113年學測-國文科第9題,B,0.0,C,"                           correct answer: (C)                           Explanation:                           The passage suggests that people are accustomed to the traditional serif fonts, which makes the textual landscape unlikely to change much. This is due to people being familiar with and comfortable reading close-range in these fonts."
9,113年學測-國文科第10題,A,0.0,,"                           correct answer(s): [A]                           Explanation:                           The passage discusses the limitations of the new-minchu typeface (新細明體) and its suitability for different purposes. It states that new-minchu typeface is not suitable for distant reading, as its thin strokes make it difficult to read and identify. It is more appropriate for ""internal text"" (內文), such as reports or texts meant for close reading. The passage also mentions that new-minchu typeface is widely used and may continue to be a popular choice due to its availability and familiarity. Therefore, the correct answer is [A], as it highlights the limitations of the new-minchu typeface and its suitability for internal text."
10,113年學測-國文科第11題,C,1.0,C,"                           correct answer: (C)                           Explanation:                           The question asks about the writing style of the novel ""盲目"" (Blindness) by José Saramago. The passage describes how the characters experience life without sight and how they navigate through their world. It also mentions the feelings and thoughts of the characters as they regain their vision. The writing style is characterized by a lack of clear guidance, which creates an atmosphere of confusion and disorientation for both the characters and the readers. This is best captured by option (C), which states that the novel employs an ""almost aimless"" writing style that evokes the feeling of ""groping forward"" for the characters."
11,113年學測-國文科第12題,A,0.0,D,"                           correct answer: (D)                           Explanation:                           Since the text content is not provided, it is difficult to determine the appropriateness of options ① and ②.

The passage states that Zhou Guangzhong repents after committing the three evils and reforms his life.

The movie's central concept revolves around the ""three demons"" of greed, anger, and delusion, which are personified as two fugitives. Therefore, the most appropriate explanation is (D), which focuses on the legend of the concept of the three demons and its transformation in the story."

(B) The text does not mention that jade grew up in a ""paradise"" protected by his father and enjoyed the beauty of spring.                           (C) The text suggests that Jade's father, Jade, is responsible for handling family affairs and is more practical and focused on reality, which may be why he cannot understand Jade's romantic nature.                           (D) The text does not mention that Jade's father believes that Jade should build a utopian world away from the world for his family."

The phrase ""有深意存焉"" implies that there is a deeper meaning hidden in the character's actions or words. Option (B) states that ""through experiences, learning to bear responsibility is a mature way to face life."" This answer aligns with the idea of a deeper meaning, as it suggests that Jing Zheng's character demonstrates the importance of maturity and responsibility in facing life's challenges."

Explanation:                           The question is about the statement that best describes the information given in the text about emotional signals. The correct option is (A) because the text suggests that facial expressions are more universally understood than verbal communication, indicating that they are a more universal emotional signal. Option (B) is incorrect because the text does not discuss the control of facial expressions by will compared to body movements."

In this case, the correct option is (D) because it describes Xiaoyi's inference based on a historical account, which is related to emotions and reactions. The other options (A), (B), and (C) are either unrelated to emotions or describe events rather than emotional responses."

The other options do not directly address the concepts discussed in the passage."

(B) The fact: Zhang Qi has bought the elementum and believes he should continue to have the right to raise the son - This option presents the main content of the document, which is about Zhang Qi's purchase of the elementum and his belief in his right to raise the son.                           (C) The verdict: Liu Kui must compensate Zhang Qi and cannot restore the father-son relationship with the elementum - This option explains the outcome of the ancient judgment, stating that Liu Kui must compensate Zhang Qi and cannot regain the father-son relationship with the elementum.

The only statement that can be confirmed from the passage is (C), which discusses Han Yu's admiration for Ruan Ji's integrity but disagreement with his strict adherence to the relationship between masters and disciples."

The person in charge of the examination was the ""中書舍人"" (Zhongshu Shegn, roughly equivalent to a chancellor or minister) at that time. The passage also describes the relationship between the examiner and the candidates, which is related to the ""座主"" (chairman) and ""門生"" (disciples) roles.

(B) The word ""fleeting"" is appropriate here, as it means lasting only for a short time, which fits the description of a dream.                           (C) The word ""unique"" is suitable in this context, as it means being the only one of its kind or being unlike anything else.                           (D) The word ""pioneers"" is fitting in this context, as it means a person who is among the first to explore or settle a new region or field.                           (E) The word ""naive"" is appropriate here, as it means lacking experience, wisdom, or good judgment, which describes Xiaochen's behavior.                           Therefore, choose (C) as the most appropriate word in the context of the underlined words in the sentence."
