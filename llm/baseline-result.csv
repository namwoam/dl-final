113年學測-社會科第58題,日本治臺後，將女子教育納入學制系統，但受到傳統「女子無才便是德」的觀念限制，相較於臺灣男學生與日籍女學生，臺灣女童受教育的仍屬少數。初等女子教育規劃的課程內容，以日語、裁縫科及家政科等課程為主。女子中等學校雖早在1897年某都市就成立「國語學校第一附屬學校女子分校」，但直到1920年代後各地才陸續設立。女子就學率提升之後，開始有女醫師、看護婦、助產士、女教員等專門或半專門職業人士。不過，有學者指出，當時女性仍高度集中於家政和照顧類有關的職業，而非平均分布於各職業類別。請問： 根據題文，日治時期初等女子教育的課程設計理念應為何？(A)為求男女平權而提高女童就學率 (B)訓練醫師、教員等專門職業人才 (C)提供殖民統治所需要之基層人員 (D)培養具日本女性婦德的賢妻良母,D,1.0,D

113年學測-英文科第43題,"In 2020, Petur Oddsson, a power station worker in Iceland, was struck by a 60,000-volt current. The electrical shock burned almost half of his body and melted layers of his skin off. Such deep and extensive burns can be fatal. But Oddsson’s life was saved by a creative invention: transplanting codfish skins onto human bodies. A  triumph  for  medical  technology, Oddsson’s fish skin transplantation  was actually part of the astonishing  achievement  of “100% Fish,” an ambitious task in promoting environmental efficiency. The Icelandic  project,  from  which  this  pioneering  procedure  emerged,  strives  for  making  a  fundamental change in the marine industry. It aims to encourage full utilization of each fish caught, and to strengthen innovation in seafood products. Reducing waste of fish catch has become a serious issue today, when many countries are faced with food crises. According to a 2003 study, about 60% of a codfish caught in Iceland was lost or wasted during the production process for human consumption. Under the guidance of 100% Fish, however, Icelanders are now using almost 95% of a cod. Cod skin, for example, is made into calcium supplement and energy drinks, and even as material for skin transplantation as in Oddsson’s case. Dried fish heads and spines are exported to  West  Africa,  where  they  are  used  as  the  base  of  a  protein-rich  soup.  Other  groundbreaking  products, including Omega-3 capsules, cold virus pretreatment sprays, and dog snacks are made from what was once cod catch detritus. The  Icelandic  success is  accomplished largely through cooperative efforts across various  industries. 100% Fish takes  the initiative to show seafood companies  the importance of collaboration, and facilitate valuable connections between fishing companies and other participants of the project, including academia, start-ups, and research and development teams. By sharing knowledge and information, the different sectors are able to come up with improved processing and handling, through which creation of various innovative products was made possible. The project not only helps Icelanders to get 30% more value from each cod than  most  developed  countries,  but  also  provides  an  effective  model  to  promote  resource  efficiency worldwide. What is the primary goal of 100% Fish? (A) To advance ocean technology. (B) To reduce food crises worldwide. (C) To enhance cross-industry cooperation. (D) To make the most of marine resources.",D,1.0,D
