However, it does mention that these measures were implemented due to the epidemic and the army's extensive plundering, which negatively impacted the economy and production.

In the given sentences, the words are used to provide additional information about the nouns that follow them, which can be expressed with the use of the ""的"" particle in Mandarin Chinese. This makes option (C) the most appropriate choice."

This is expressed in the line ""早年已悟繁華如夢，遂於書中深自懺悔"" which means ""early on, he realized that worldly success is like a dream, and he deeply regretted this in his book."" Therefore, option (D) is the most accurate description of the content of ""Shaoren Mengyi."""

(D) The passage describes ""han shi"" as failing academically and losing confidence in his knowledge, which leads him to doubt whether his experiences were real or a dream."

This implies that he is uncertain about how others will evaluate his work, and as a result, he does not mind any criticism. Option (A) best captures this sentiment, as it suggests that the author is unable to predict the opinions of others on his paintings and is therefore unconcerned with any comments."
14,111年學測-國文科第15題,D,0.0,B,"                           correct answer: (B)                           Explanation:                           The text in (B) states that women's writing should break away from the traditional patterns of ""red and green"", focusing on expressing their own emotions. This idea is most closely related to option (B) because it emphasizes avoiding established forms and focusing on expressing true feelings."
15,111年學測-國文科第16題,C,0.0,B,"                           correct answer: (B)                           Explanation:                           (A) is appropriate as it reflects the idea that Zhang Lihe's adherence to traditional gender roles is evident in his writing.                           (C) is appropriate as both passages discuss the suitability of creativity from a gender perspective.                           (D) is appropriate as the examples mentioned by Bai may indeed break away from traditional gender stereotypes more than those mentioned in Alpha.                           However, (B) is inappropriate because Bai's statement does not accurately represent the essence of female creativity. Instead, she emphasizes the importance of individual expression and the range of creative topics and styles that women can explore."

The moonlight in the empty room, the spring water in the Autumn valley                           Explanation:                           The question mentions that women's works focus on describing red and green, expressing complaints and feelings of love. Option (A) is the most similar style to this description, as it talks about moonlight in an empty room and spring water in an Autumn valley, which can be associated with feelings of love and emotions. The other options do not mention colors or express feelings as directly related to the given description."

Explanation:                           The passage is from Lü Buwei's Ruling of the States, and the question asks for the best advice or way to handle a situation. Option (C) is the most appropriate response, as it describes the ideal behavior for a gentleman in a delicate situation. Options (A), (B), and (D) do not directly address the issue at hand and do not provide relevant advice."

The other options do not accurately represent the views expressed in the passage."
19,111年學測-國文科第20題,C,0.0,A,"                           Correct answer: (A)                           Explanation:                           The question asks about the criteria for designating a historical site, specifically a national treasure. According to the provided information, the criteria for designating a historical site should be based on the historical, artistic, or scientific value of the site. In the case of the ""Chuang Yun Heritage Site,"" it is mentioned that it is a national treasure with a high level of historical and artistic value. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) ""具高度歷史、藝術或科學價值者"" (has a high degree of historical, artistic, or scientific value)."
20,111年學測-國文科第21題,D,0.0,B,"                           correct answer: (B)                           Explanation:                           (A) The passage does not mention Zeng Zhidao's belief in his ancestors' protection or his instructions to his descendants.                           (B) This option accurately describes the tomb's location and that Zeng Yushi followed his ancestor's instructions.                           (C) The passage does not mention the tomb's original design or Zeng Yushi's imperial examination.                           (D) The passage does not mention the inscription on the tombstone or official recognition.                           Therefore, choose (B) as the correct answer."
21,111年學測-國文科第22題,D,0.0,B,"                           correct answer: (B) Daoguang 25th year                           Explanation:                           The question asks for the year when Zhonggong Zhaochunhe's wife's original burial site in Bao'an Mountain was moved to join her husband's. Zhonggong Zhaochunhe passed away in the Daoguang 7th year, and his wife passed away in the Daoguang 25th year. Therefore, her burial site was moved in the Daoguang 25th year to join her husband's."
22,111年學測-國文科第23題,C,0.0,A,"                           correct answer(s): (A)                           Explanation:                           The question asks for Zhu Xi's explanation of the passage from the Analects of Confucius and the Book of Mencius. The correct option is (A) because it accurately summarizes Zhu Xi's explanation. Option (A) states that ""Greater number of people"" refers to those who hold high positions, wealth, and dignity, and that fearing heaven means understanding the mandate of heaven and being cautious in one's actions. It also emphasizes the importance of understanding the mandate of heaven and acting accordingly without daring to disobey."
23,111年學測-國文科第24題,D,0.0,B,"                           correct answer: (B) 項羽                           Explanation:                           The question asks which figure's actions most closely resemble the ""adults"" that Mencius disapproves of in the given passage. In the context of the passage, Mencius criticizes those who take their high status for granted and do not respect others or their positions.                           (A) 鄭文公 - He was respectful towards other states, such as Qi, and did not show excessive pride.                           (B) 項羽 - He was known for his arrogance and disregard for others, such as when he scornfully asked the envoy who he was when he entered his presence without proper ceremony. This behavior aligns with Mencius's description of someone who takes their high status for granted and does not respect others.                           (C) 劉備 - He was humble and respected others, such as his advisor Zhuge Liang. He never took his own high status for granted.                           (D) 楊素 - He was known for his pride and disregard for proper etiquette, but the passage specifically mentions that he respected others' positions, which is not the focus of Mencius's criticism.                           Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 項羽, as his actions most closely resemble the ""adults"" that Mencius disapproves of in the passage."

(C) is incorrect because it does not mention the small people's behavior towards adults.                           (D) is incorrect because it does not mention Mencius's perspective on ridiculing adults.                           (B) is the correct answer because it accurately describes the information provided in sections A and B, mentioning that the small people ridicule adults and disrespect sages, and that they cannot understand destiny."

(D) 內 and 已 both indicate completion or inclusion. In the first sentence, 內 means ""included"" and 已 means ""completed."" In the second sentence, 內 means ""included"" and 已 means ""completed"" as well.                           (B) 見 and (C) 知 have similar meanings, but they are not the same in both sentences.

The flower's act of blooming represents the expression of one's true nature, regardless of whether others understand or appreciate it. Option (E) captures this idea best, stating that the opening of the flower symbolizes the faithful expression of oneself and that the cliff represents the misunderstanding by others."
