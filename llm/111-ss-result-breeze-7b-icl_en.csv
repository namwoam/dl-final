(B) The report suggests that indigenous people do not take responsibility for their health, which could lead to a negative perception of their attitude towards self-care.                           (C) The report implies that indigenous people prefer unhealthy food choices, which may lead to the perception that they lack the knowledge to maintain a healthy traditional food culture.                           (D) The lack of empathy and understanding in the report may create the perception that indigenous people are unable to adapt to modern lifestyles, as they are portrayed as resistant to change and focused on unhealthy habits."
1,111年學測-社會科第2題,C,0,A,                           correct answer: (A)                           Explanation:                           The most fundamental difference pointed out by the scholar in the political propaganda picture (Graph 1) is that multiple competing parties make it difficult for a party to have widespread loyalty from the public. This highlights the challenge faced by a political party in gaining and maintaining public support when there are multiple parties vying for the same loyalty.
2,111年學測-社會科第3題,B,0,A,"                           correct answer: (A)                           Explanation:                           The question states that Wade concludes the gender differences in inheritance statistics are due to the country's traditional social attitudes and the application of the law of inheritance. Option (A) states that the Civil Code adopts gender equality in the inheritance of inheritance rights, which directly contradicts the observed gender differences in the statistics. Therefore, (A) is the most closely related principle to the gender differences mentioned in the question."
3,111年學測-社會科第4題,B,1,B,"                           correct answer: (B)                           Explanation:                           Since the number and quality of motorcycles purchased in the past two years are the same, the only factor changing is the government subsidy amount. This means that the incentives for purchasing new low-emission motorcycles are more attractive this year compared to last year. As a result, more people are willing to upgrade to new low-emission motorcycles. Additionally, this year's policy with higher subsidies should be more effective in reducing air pollution than last year's policy."
4,111年學測-社會科第5題,A,1,A,"                           correct answer: (A) the movement and communication of populations                           Explanation:                           The required materials for the ""historical investigation"" course, such as family trees, Taiwan Governor's Travel Permits (passports), and fellow town association lists, suggest that the focus is on individual and community-level information. This information is most relevant to understanding the movement and communication of populations. Options (B), (C), and (D) are more focused on broader themes and historical events that may not be directly related to the provided materials."
5,111年學測-社會科第6題,C,1,C,"                           correct answer: (C) The coastal sea god belief in Qing Dynasty Taiwan                           Explanation:                           The question refers to a scholar who emphasizes the history of the people rather than rulers. Option (C) focuses on the belief system of the people, specifically the coastal sea god belief, which aligns with the scholar's main concern for the history of the people. The other options focus on political and administrative aspects, which do not directly relate to the history of the people."
6,111年學測-社會科第7題,C,1,C,"                           correct answer: (C) Communism                           Explanation:                           The person's viewpoint reflects Communism because they criticize the use of money and advocate for the government to provide goods and work income. This ideology seeks to eliminate private property and wealth inequality, emphasizing a collective, communal system."
7,111年學測-社會科第9題,D,0,A,"                           correct answer: (A) Korea                           Explanation:                           The description provided in the question matches the Changdeokgung Palace in Korea, which was built during the 15th to 16th centuries and served as a place for receiving envoys from various countries, including China and Japan. The other options, Sarawak, Annam, and Ryukyu, do not have historical palaces that match the given description."
8,111年學測-社會科第10題,B,1,B,"                           correct answer: (B) The West Indies of Central America                           Explanation:                           The West Indies, located in Central America, was a significant sugar producer during the 17th century. The Caribbean region was a major source of sugar for Europe, and many plantations were established there. The other options are not as closely associated with the sugar production during that time period. Algeria (A) is in North Africa and was not a significant sugar producer, Newfoundland (C) in North America was not a major sugar producer, and the Congo Basin (D) in Central Africa was not a significant sugar producer until the late 19th century."
9,111年學測-社會科第11題,B,0,A,"                           correct answer: (A)                           Explanation:                           The Xuantong Dynasty lasted 12 years, not three. The abdication occurred on December 25, 1912, marking the end of the Qing Dynasty and the beginning of the Republic of China. The document with the ""Xuantong Ten Years July"" date is likely a mistake made by a Qing government official who mistakenly inserted the year."
10,111年學測-社會科第12題,C,1,C,"                           correct answer: (C)                           Explanation:                           The architectural decorations on the shikumen houses in Kinmen, such as lucky mandarins, wheat sheaves, and crabs, as well as Western clocks and Indian coolies carrying roofs, reflect the influence of the early Republic of China when overseas Chinese brought back Western architecture and integrated it into Kinmen's traditional decoration."
11,111年學測-社會科第13題,B,1,B,"                           correct answer: (B)                           Explanation: The Soviet Union was the main battlefield of World War II, experiencing widespread destruction and loss of life due to the war and associated issues such as famine. This contributed to the significantly higher number of civilian deaths and death rate in the Soviet Union compared to Germany."
12,111年學測-社會科第14題,A,0,C,"                           correct answer(s): (C) Netherlands, United Kingdom, Spain                           Explanation:                           By analyzing Figure 3, we can see that the number of ships from the Netherlands is the highest, followed by the United Kingdom and Spain. Therefore, the top three countries are the Netherlands, United Kingdom, and Spain."
13,111年學測-社會科第15題,B,0,C,"                           correct answer: (C) September 18th Incident                           Explanation:                           The passage describes a department store in Shanghai that faced public pressure to stop selling certain Chinese goods and prioritize Chinese products over foreign goods. This event occurred during the September 18th Incident (1936), when Japanese products were boycotted in China, and stores were pressured to support Chinese goods. The store mentioned in the passage responded by expressing their support for Chinese goods and their commitment to stop selling certain Chinese goods, even at the cost of sacrificing profits."
14,111年學測-社會科第16題,C,1,C,"                           correct answer: (C)                           Explanation:                           (A) The passage does not mention the establishment duration of Manchukuo.                           (B) The passage does not mention the friendly relations between Sino-Japanese.                           (C) The passage states that there were many Chinese immigrants in Taiwan and a consulate had been set up, which provides a reason for the celebration.                           (D) The passage does not mention the ""imperialization policy"" or the celebration being held to woo the people of Taiwan.                           Therefore, choose (C)"
15,111年學測-社會科第17題,A,0,B,"                           correct answer: (B) He stole the technology from Britain and brought it back to Japan.                           Explanation: The power loom technology was unparalleled in the early 19th century, and Britain was the leading country in the Industrial Revolution. It is most likely that the foreign engineer stole the technology from Britain and brought it back to Japan, as Japan was trying to catch up with the Western powers during this time."
16,111年學測-社會科第19題,D,1,D,"                           correct answer: (D) Core and Periphery                           Explanation:                           The ""Core and Periphery"" concept refers to the uneven distribution of resources and development between the center (core) and the periphery (peripheral countries) in the world economy. In the context of COVID-19 vaccines, developed countries with more resources and advanced economies (like the EU, the United States, China, and India) have prioritized their citizens and implemented export controls, leading to a vaccine production discrepancy. In contrast, African countries, which are considered part of the periphery, face a severe shortage of vaccines. This situation can be best explained by the Core and Periphery concept."
17,111年學測-社會科第21題,C,1,C,"                           correct answer: (C)                           Explanation:                           The question describes fair trade producers and their common spatial and temporal backgrounds. The options provided are related to different historical and geographical contexts.                           (A) refers to the Arab Empire, which is not the primary focus of fair trade producers in recent times.                           (B) mentions East Asian population migrations, which are also not directly related to the modern fair trade movement.                           (D) discusses the rivalry between the US and the Soviet Union, which is not relevant to the producers depicted in Figure 4.                           (C) mentions tropical climates being colonized by European powers in the twentieth century, which aligns with the current context of fair trade and its focus on developing countries in tropical regions.                           Therefore, the correct answer is (C)."
18,111年學測-社會科第23題,C,0,A,"                           correct answer: (A) Globalization and Regional Alliances                           Explanation: The question focuses on the labor shortage in Australia's agriculture industry, which is a result of border control measures during the COVID-19 pandemic. This situation highlights the relationship between globalization, specifically regional alliances, and the movement of labor across borders. Option (A) is the most suitable topic to explore this relationship, as it directly addresses the impact of globalization on regional cooperation and labor mobility."
19,111年學測-社會科第24題,D,0,ABD,"                           correct answers: (A), (B), (D)                           Explanation:                           (A) Alpha policy is included in government spending, with no direct impact on GDP. This is because government spending can either be expansionary or contractionary, depending on the specifics of the policy. In this case, the passage does not provide enough information to determine whether the alpha policy would have a direct impact on GDP.                           (B) Alpha policy is considered as government transfer payments, increasing GDP. This is because transfer payments are a form of government spending that can directly impact GDP, as they increase the income of recipients, who in turn may increase their consumption, stimulating the economy.                           (D) Delta policy is considered as government transfer payments, with no direct impact on GDP. This is because the passage states that the delta policy has no direct impact on GDP, unlike the alpha policy, which does have a direct impact.                           Therefore, choose (A), (B), (D)"
20,111年學測-社會科第28題,C,0,A,"                           correct answer: (A) Fujian                           Explanation:                           The question provides information about the optimal temperature range for the growth of crop A, which is 20°C - 30°C. Fujian, located in China, has a climate that falls within this temperature range and is suitable for crop A production. Guangzhou, Taipei, and Keelung have different climates and may not be suitable for the growth of crop A. Therefore, the most suitable option is (A) Fujian."
21,111年學測-社會科第32題,D,0,A,"                           correct answer: (A)                           Explanation:                           The question describes a tidal flat, which is a landscape feature found in the intertidal zone. This implies that the trail must be located near a coastal estuary, where freshwater from rivers and streams mixes with saltwater from the ocean. In Figure 6, trail A is the only option shown near a coastal area, suggesting that it is most likely built along the estuary."
22,111年學測-社會科第33題,A,1,A,"                           Correct answer: (A) Alpha                           Explanation:                           According to the principle of fish traps, the optimal orientation for maximizing the catch is perpendicular to the water current. In Figure 7, Fish trap 2 is oriented perpendicular to the water current, which is represented by the arrow pointing to the right. This orientation is closest to Alpha, making it the most likely choice adopted by fishermen to maximize their catch."
23,111年學測-社會科第34題,A,1,A,"                           correct answer: (A)                           Explanation:                           The official's view, as stated in his diary, is that the cause of turmoil is the population being too large, which implies that the area is exceeding its carrying capacity. This is closest to reason (A). Reasons (B), (C), and (D) do not directly address the official's view on population growth causing unrest."
24,111年學測-社會科第36題,C,1,C,"                           correct answer: (C) Gamma                           Explanation:                           The question asks about the economic activities most likely at that time based on the bureaucratic argument for slowing population growth. The bureaucratic argument often focuses on efficient organization and management, which is related to Gamma (Γ) in the list of options. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) Gamma."
25,111年學測-社會科第37題,D,1,D,"                           correct answer: (D) The railway construction preceded the development of the area.                           Explanation:                           By comparing Fig 8 and Fig 9, it is evident that the railway construction (D) preceded the development of the area, as the railway is present in Fig 8 but not in Fig 9. This indicates that the railway was built first, and the surrounding area was then developed. The other options do not have sufficient evidence from the images to support their claims."
26,111年學測-社會科第38題,A,1,A,"                           correct answer: (A) Yulin-Anping                           Explanation:                           The question is about the exchange of goods during the martial law period in Taiwan, which lasted from 1948 to 1989. The Yulin-Anping route is the only option that is located within Taiwan, indicating that it was likely one of the routes allowed for the exchange of goods during this time. The other options involve crossing international borders, which would have been restricted under martial law."
27,111年學測-社會科第39題,C,1,C,"                           correct answer: (C)                           Explanation:                           The second article of the Martial Law Proclamation aimed to control the influx of mainland military and civilians into Taiwan to maintain political stability in Taiwan. This is because the influx of mainland military and civilians could potentially disrupt the existing social and political order in Taiwan. Options (A), (B), and (D) are not directly related to the main purpose of the second article of the Martial Law Proclamation."
28,111年學測-社會科第40題,B,1,B,"                           correct answer: (B)                           Explanation:                           The fourth article of the Martial Law Proclamation imposed the death penalty for various acts without distinguishing between major and minor offenses, which violates the principle of proportionality in criminal law. This is the reason option (B) is the correct answer."
29,111年學測-社會科第41題,D,1,D,                           correct answer: (D)                           Explanation:                           The joint revocation of the martial law announcement with three signatures indicates that the president's decision requires the approval of the Executive Yuan (represented by the premier) and the Ministry of National Defense (represented by the minister of defense). This relationship and operation between the president and the Executive Yuan contain elements of a parliamentary system.
30,111年學測-社會科第42題,B,0,A,"                           correct answer: (A)                           Explanation:                           The question is about the impact of free availability of map information on economic efficiency. Option (A) states that free access to map information can reduce transaction costs and improve economic efficiency, which is the most accurate answer among the given options. Options (B), (C), and (D) discuss the impact on specific market needs and value, but option (A) encompasses a broader and more accurate perspective on the overall economic efficiency."
31,111年學測-社會科第45題,C,0,A,"                           correct answer: (A)                           Explanation:                           Pan-Islamism emphasizes the unity of the Islamic world and promotes resistance against external threats, such as the invasion of Western powers. This social norm function is best highlighted by statement (A)."
32,111年學測-社會科第49題,D,0,ACD,"                           correct answer(s): (A), (C), (D)                           Explanation:                           (A) The increase in the number of female elected seats is mainly due to the increase in reserved seats for women. This statement is correct because the amendment in 2015 increased the number of reserved seats for women, leading to an increase in the number of female elected seats.                           (C) The increase in the number of female reserved seats can prove the effectiveness of affirmative action measures. This statement is correct because the increase in reserved seats for women after the amendment demonstrates that affirmative action measures can lead to greater representation of women in elected positions.                           (D) The main benefit of female reserved seats is to strengthen the incentives for women to participate in elections. This statement is correct because reserving seats for women can encourage more women to participate in politics and elections, as they have a better chance of being elected.                           Therefore, choose (A), (C), (D)"
33,111年學測-社會科第53題,B,0,D,"                           correct answer: (D)                           Explanation:                           The question is about the impact of forest fires on the country's wine market and the relationship between supply and demand. However, the given options (A), (B), and (C) discuss plastic straw usage and its regulation, not related to the wine market or forest fires. Therefore, none of the given options directly answer the question. However, since the correct answer should be chosen from the given options, option (D) is the closest to the context of the question, as it mentions the government's role in regulating plastic straw use, which is related to the text's topic of environmental concerns."
34,111年學測-社會科第57題,A,1,A,"                           correct answer: (A) Knowledge Economy Development                           Explanation: The question describes the challenges faced by companies during the COVID-19 Level 3 alert period, particularly in production planning and logistics. The strategies mentioned in the passage to cope with the impact of the epidemic include using information technology for remote customer service and operation and reducing marketing and research and development costs. These strategies align with the concept of Knowledge Economy Development, which emphasizes the importance of information technology and the efficient use of knowledge in business operations."
35,111年學測-社會科第62題,D,0,C,"                           correct answer: (C)                           Explanation:                           The question focuses on the historical account of the Japanese colonial period and its impact on indigenous communities in Taiwan. The policy that best demonstrates the changes brought about by this historical influence is the establishment of reserved lands for indigenous peoples, ensuring their livelihood and restricting the transfer of land to non-indigenous peoples. This policy directly addresses the issues raised in the historical context by providing a means for indigenous communities to protect their traditional lands and resources."
36,111年學測-社會科第66題,C,1,C,"                           correct answer: (C) Prevailing westerly trough                           Explanation:                           In ancient times, the prevailing westerly winds dominated the Earth's weather system. To travel from Jerusalem to Rome, Paul would want to avoid the influence of these winds by following a land route. The prevailing westerly trough would have made sea navigation difficult and dangerous, so the land route would be the most suitable option."
