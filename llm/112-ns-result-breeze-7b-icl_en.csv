(E) The statement that Alpha has more water vapor is consistent with the higher relative humidity in Alpha.                           (A), (C), (D), and (F) are incorrect because they do not align with the information provided in (B) and (E)."

(B) Low-pressure areas also have less precipitation, leading to higher surface salinity.                           (C) Upward draft areas have increased evaporation, but this does not directly affect surface salinity.                           (D) Downward draft areas have decreased evaporation, but this does not directly affect surface salinity.                           (E) Convergence zones of the sea wind scene have increased precipitation, leading to lower surface salinity.                           (F) Divergence zones of the sea wind scene have decreased precipitation, leading to higher surface salinity.                           Therefore, choose (A), (B), (D), (F)"

(C) The Pacific Ring of Fire and the Pacific Ring of Fire volcanic zone (fire ring) are indeed located almost side by side, with many active volcanoes.                           (D) Earthquakes are closely related to fault movements, and most earthquakes in this ring are caused by horizontal movements, as the tectonic plates slide past each other."

(B) Infected plants will also produce CMV's proteins, which can be detected in the crop.                           (C) The question mentions ""5 kinds of proteins,"" but CMV has more than 5 proteins. This option is incorrect.                           (D) A special odor is not specific to CMV infection and cannot be used to confirm it.                           (E) The presence of aphids on the crop indicates that they may be transmitting the virus but does not confirm the infection.                           Therefore, choose (A) and (B)."

(C) If the Denisova person is classified as Homo denisova, it indicates that this individual is not the same species as modern humans (Homo sapiens).                           (E) Pääbo's ancient DNA research techniques can be applied to human fossils from the Jurassic period, as they are designed to study ancient DNA and can potentially reveal information about extinct species. However, the Jurassic period is approximately 200 million years ago, and the preservation of DNA from that era is highly unlikely."
7,112年學測-自然科第13題,B,0.0,D,"                           correct answer: (D)                           Explanation:                           (A) Slicing the material with a knife may not provide a clear view of the guard cells due to the thickness of the slices.                           (B) Tearing the material with fingers may cause damage to the structure of the guard cells and make it difficult to observe their morphology.                           (C) Crushing the material with a cover glass may also damage the guard cells and disrupt their structure.                           (D) Spreading the material on a glass slide with toothpicks or dissecting needles allows for a clear and undamaged view of the guard cells, making it the best method for observing their morphology.                           (E) Placing the material directly on a glass slide may not provide a proper viewing surface and could cause the sample to move during observation."

The other options, such as the cell nucleus, mitochondria, Golgi apparatus, and endoplasmic reticulum, are specific to eukaryotic cells and not commonly found in prokaryotic cells like E. coli."
9,112年學測-自然科第15題,D,0.0,C,"                           correct answer: (C) After meiosis I, each cell has 12 pairs of chromosomes.                           Explanation:                           In humans, the normal number of chromosome pairs is 46, which is 23 pairs of homologous chromosomes. In this question, the species has 12 sets of homologous chromosomes.                           At the beginning of meiosis, the chromosome number does not change, so it remains at 12 sets or 24 pairs of homologous chromosomes.                           After meiosis I, homologous chromosomes are separated, resulting in haploid cells with 12 pairs of chromosomes.                           Options (A), (B), (D), and (E) are incorrect because they do not accurately describe the chromosome number after meiosis or the number of chromosomes in gametes."

(D) Habitat complexity can influence biodiversity, but the composition of species is not the sole factor determining ecosystem diversity. If the species composition remains unchanged but the habitat complexity increases, the diversity of ecosystems can still increase."

(C) Viruses lack the characteristics of both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, so classifying them under Prokaryota (Bacteria or Archaea) would not be accurate. Instead, a new category should be created to accommodate viruses."
12,112年學測-自然科第18題,A,1.0,A,"                           correct answer: (A)                           Explanation:                           If both A and B are homozygous recessive, crossing them will produce offspring with fruits of the same small size, confirming that the mutations A and B are due to the same gene. This is because both A and B strains produce smaller fruits when they are homozygous recessive, indicating that the small fruit phenotype is controlled by a single recessive gene."

(D) When subjected to high temperatures, ammonium nitrate decomposes and releases energy in the form of an explosion. The products are water vapor, nitrogen gas, and oxygen.                           (E) The stoichiometric coefficients in the balanced equation for the decomposition of ammonium nitrate at high temperatures are as follows: 2 NH4NO3 → 2 N2 + 4 H2O + 2 O2. The stoichiometric coefficient of each species is 2, not 9."
14,112年學測-自然科第28題,D,0.0,B,"                           correct answer: (B) Beta Gamma Zeta                           Explanation:                           (A) Thomson discovered electrons, but it was through cathode rays experiment, not directly through experimentation.                           (B) Beta: Rutherford proposed a model of the atom with a positive charge concentrated in the core and electrons distributed in the outer shell. This is correct.                           (C) Gamma: Ampere discovered the magnetic field around a conductor, but it was through the experiment with two parallel wires, not a conductor carrying current.                           (D) Alpha and Delta are incorrect because Thomson discovered electrons and Hertz proposed the electromagnetic wave nature of light, but it was Maxwell who first developed the electromagnetic theory.                           (E) Alpha and Zeta are incorrect because Faraday discovered electromagnetic induction and Einstein proposed the photoelectric effect, not the quantized nature of energy.                           Therefore, choose (B) Beta Gamma Zeta."
15,112年學測-自然科第29題,ADE,0.19999999999999996,ACD,"                           correct answers: (A), (C), (D)                           Explanation:                           (A) In a negative pressure room, the air pressure inside is lower than outside, creating a flow of air from the room to the outside, reducing the risk of pathogen leakage.                           (C) A healthy person's body temperature is in thermal equilibrium with the surrounding environment when it is normal, meaning it is not actively generating or losing heat.                           (D) Using an ice pack on the forehead can lower the forehead temperature during a fever, mainly through conduction, which transfers heat away from the body."
16,112年學測-自然科第34題,E,0.0,A,"                           correct answer: (A) Alpha, Beta, Gamma                           Explanation:                           The question is about energy, but the options are not related to specific energy concepts. Instead, they appear to be Chinese characters (Ding and Yi) and the Greek alphabet (Alpha, Beta, Gamma). Therefore, the correct answer is (A) Alpha, Beta, Gamma, as these are the only options that consist of Latin characters and are commonly associated with energy in the context of physics (e.g., Alpha particles, Beta decay, and Gamma radiation)."
17,112年學測-自然科第37題,D,0.0,C,"                           correct answer: (C) 10^2                           Explanation:                           The specific kinetic energy (KE) of a mass (m) can be calculated using the formula:                           KE = 0.5 * m * u^2 * g                           In this case, the water level difference (h) is 100 m, and the gravitational acceleration (g) is 10 m/s². When the water reaches the intake of the generator, the specific kinetic energy per unit mass (uw) is asked for.                           Since the water level difference is 100 m, the velocity (u) of the water can be calculated as:                           u = sqrt(2 * g * h) = sqrt(2 * 10 m/s² * 100 m) = sqrt(2000 m²/s²) = 10 m/s                           Now, plug the values into the KE formula:                           KE = 0.5 * m * (10 m/s)² * 10 m/s²                           KE = 0.5 * m * 1000 J/kg                           KE = 500 J/kg                           Since the specific kinetic energy is asked per unit mass, the uw is 500 J/kg. However, the options provided are in powers of 10, so the closest option is (C) 10^2, or 100 J/kg."
18,112年學測-自然科第38題,B,0.0,A,"                           correct answer: (A) Alpha Epsilon                           Explanation:                           The question is related to hydroelectric power plant planning and reducing CO2 emissions. The options provided are likely to be Greek letters representing different engineering or environmental factors. In this context, ""Alpha Epsilon"" is often used to represent efficiency, which is a critical parameter in determining the power output of a generator. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) Alpha Epsilon."
19,112年學測-自然科第39題,A,0.0,F,"                           correct answer(s): (F) Gamma Tau                           Explanation:                           The question asks to estimate the reduction in CO2 emissions per unit of electricity generated when adopting hydroelectric power instead of coal-fired power. This requires comparing the CO2 emissions per unit of electricity for both hydroelectric and coal-fired power. In the given options, Gamma Tau represents the CO2 emissions per unit of electricity for coal-fired power, and it needs to be compared with the CO2 emissions for hydroelectric power, which is not provided in Table 5. Therefore, the correct option to obtain the values for is (F) Gamma Tau."
20,112年學測-自然科第41題,E,0.0,CD,"                           correct answer(s): (C), (D)                           Explanation:                           (C) Mars has an appropriate distance from the Sun, allowing its polar ice caps to contain water ice. The presence of water ice on Mars' surface makes it possible for liquid water to exist.                           (D) The North Star for Earth is Polaris, while the North Star for Mars is Alpha Centauri. However, this difference does not make it difficult to lose direction on Mars. Navigation primarily relies on the position of celestial bodies and landmarks on the Martian surface."
21,112年學測-自然科第42題,D,0.0,B,"                           correct answer: (B) Red                           Explanation:                           The color of an object, including stars, is determined by the wavelengths of light it reflects or emits. When light from a distant star, like Pleiades, reaches us, the wavelengths it carries get stretched due to the expansion of the universe. This stretching of wavelengths is more pronounced for shorter wavelengths (blue and violet) than for longer wavelengths (red and orange).                           When we observe Pleiades from Earth, the light takes about 25.3 light-years to reach us. This means the light we see left the star 25.3 million years ago. During this time, the light's wavelengths have been stretched, causing the star to appear blue-white.                           On Mars, the wavelengths of light in the star's light would be further stretched due to Mars' position being even farther from Earth than Earth is from the Sun. This additional stretching would cause the star's light to appear more reddened than when observed from Earth. Therefore, the Pleiades star cluster would most likely appear red if observed on Mars."
22,112年學測-自然科第43題,A,0.0,BD,"                           correct answer(s): (B), (D)                           Explanation:                           (B) Mars has a shorter axial tilt (25.18°) than Earth (23.45°), resulting in shorter and less pronounced seasons.                           (D) At Mars local noon during the vernal equinox, the solar declination angle is approximately 65 degrees due to its axial tilt and orbital characteristics."
23,112年學測-自然科第45題,C,0.0,A,"                           correct answer: (A) increases about 1.3 times                           Explanation:                           The question describes the process of making cheese, where lactose is converted into lactic acid, causing casein to coagulate. The pH at which coagulation begins is given as 5.3, while the initial pH of milk is 6.6. To find the change in hydrogen ion concentration, we need to calculate the difference in pH values:6.6 (initial pH) - 5.3 (coagulation pH) = 1.3Since pH is the negative logarithm of hydrogen ion concentration, a one-unit increase in pH corresponds to a tenfold decrease in hydrogen ion concentration. Therefore, a one-unit decrease in pH (from 6.6 to 5.3) corresponds to an increase in hydrogen ion concentration of 10 times or 0.30 in log2. This is approximately equal to an increase of 1.3 times, so the correct answer is (A)."

(E) Whey protein is more soluble in water under acidic conditions than casein: Whey protein has a lower isoelectric point than casein, meaning it remains soluble in water at lower pH values. This difference in solubility contributes to the separation of curds and whey during cheese production."

(C) Random errors in selecting parent plants may result in some plants not being true-breeding, causing deviations in the observed ratios.                           (E) The sample size of the experiment is still too small, which may not provide a statistically significant result, leading to discrepancies between the observed and expected ratios."
26,112年學測-自然科第49題,BCD,0.0,ABE,"                           correct answers: (A), (B), (E)                           Explanation:                           (A) This statement is an extension of Mendel's models because it explains how dominant alleles may have a better chance of survival and reproduction in a given environment, leading to a higher frequency of these traits in the population over time.                           (B) Controlled conditions, such as a greenhouse, can help reduce environmental variables that may affect the phenotypes, leading to results closer to the expected values.                           (C) This statement refers to Darwin's natural selection, which is a separate concept from Mendel's genetic models. It does not accurately extend Mendel's models.                           (D) The sex-linked inheritance factors being on the same chromosome does not affect the ratio of the phenotypes Mendel obtained, as the basic principles of Mendelian inheritance remain the same.                           (E) If only smooth seeds were cultured from the F1 generation, the wrinkled alleles would eventually be eliminated from the population due to genetic drift, leading to a higher frequency of smooth seeds in the population. This demonstrates how genetic drift can affect the phenotype ratios observed in Mendel's experiments."
