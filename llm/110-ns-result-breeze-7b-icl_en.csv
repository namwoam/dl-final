0,110年學測-自然科第1題,A,1.0,A,"                           correct answer: (A)                           Explanation: Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning causes severe oxygen deficiency in the blood by competing with oxygen (O2) for hemoglobin binding sites. This results in the reduced ability of hemoglobin to carry oxygen, leading to oxygen deficiency in tissues and organs, including the brain and heart. High-pressure oxygen therapy helps alleviate the symptoms of CO poisoning by increasing the concentration of oxygen in the blood and displacing CO from hemoglobin, allowing the body to recover."
1,110年學測-自然科第2題,E,0.0,D,"                           correct answer(s): (D)                           Explanation:                           (A) Alpha cells are Leydig cells, which produce testosterone, and Gamma cells are Sertoli cells, which support sperm production and have a resemblance to sperm. They are not reproductive cells themselves.                           (B) Beta cells are not mentioned in the question, so we cannot assume they have a diploid chromosome.                           (C) There is no mention of Beta cells being derived from Alpha cells through metaplasia.                           (D) Gamma cells (Sertoli cells) play a crucial role in sperm production and have the ability to undergo meiosis."
2,110年學測-自然科第3題,D,0.0,C,"                           correct answer: (C)                           Explanation:                           Short-day plants require a photoperiod (daylight hours) shorter than their critical day length (13 hours in this case) to initiate flowering. At the equator, day and night lengths are equal at the winter solstice, which means the photoperiod is 12 hours, shorter than the critical day length of 13 hours. Therefore, it is least likely to bloom at the winter solstice at the equator."
3,110年學測-自然科第5題,D,0.0,E,"                           correct answer: (E)                           Explanation:                           (A) Cellular respiration involves redox reactions, as oxygen is reduced to form water and carbon dioxide is oxidized.                           (B) The formation of coal involves redox reactions, as organic matter is decomposed and transformed under anaerobic conditions.                           (C) Burning coal or oil involves redox reactions, as they are oxidized to produce energy and release carbon dioxide.                           (D) The dissolution of carbon dioxide in water and its reaction with calcium ions to form calcium carbonate involves redox reactions.                           (E) Photosynthesis involves the reduction of carbon dioxide to glucose and the oxidation of water to oxygen, which is not a redox reaction."
4,110年學測-自然科第6題,B,0.0,ABCD,"                           correct answer(s): (A), (B), (C), (D)                           Explanation:                           (A) Human plasma has a pH of around 7.4, which is neither acidic nor alkaline enough to affect phenolphthalein paper.                           (B) Commercial antacids are alkaline substances, usually containing substances like calcium carbonate or magnesium hydroxide, which react with the phenolphthalein paper to produce a blue color.                           (C) Phenolphthalein paper is used as an acid-base indicator. When it comes into contact with an acidic solution like hydrochloric acid (HCl), an acid-base reaction occurs, turning the paper white.                           (D) Benzyl alcohol has a slightly acidic pH, which would not cause a color change on red phenolphthalein paper.                           (E) A solution with a pH of 6.4 is only slightly alkaline, and it would not cause a color change on red phenolphthalein paper.                           Therefore, choose (A), (B), (C), (D)."

The higher the enthalpy of combustion, the more stable the compound. In this case, Butene is the least stable, and Acetic acid is the most stable."
7,110年學測-自然科第10題,A,0.0,B,"                           correct answer: (B) Zinc sulfide                           Explanation:                           (A) Quartz sand is a poor conductor of electricity and does not contain elements essential for the semiconductor industry or the human body.                           (B) Zinc sulfide is a semiconductor material used in the electronics industry and is also an essential element for the human body as it is a component of various enzymes.                           (C) Calcium chloride is important for the semiconductor industry, but it does not exist in the human body.                           (D) Iron oxide is essential for the human body, but it does not contribute to the semiconductor industry.                           (E) Marble is not a semiconductor material and does not contain elements essential for the human body.                           Therefore, choose (B) Zinc sulfide."

9,110年學測-自然科第13題,A,0.0,BC,"                           correct answer(s): (B), (C)                           Explanation:                           (B) The main interaction between protons and neutrons in the atomic nucleus is the strong force, not weak force.                           (C) The range of the strong force's effect is indeed smaller than that of the weak force.                           (A), (D), (E) are incorrect because:                           (A) Elastic deformation force is related to the physical properties of materials, not electromagnetic forces.                           (D) Electron decay is not a recognized phenomenon in modern physics, and it is not caused by weak force interactions.                           (E) Gravity is one of the four fundamental interaction forces between objects."
10,110年學測-自然科第14題,C,0.0,BCD,"                           correct answers: (B), (C), (D)                           Explanation:                           (B) Pressure is defined as force per unit area, which in SI units is represented as N/m² (Newtons per square meter).                           (C) Power is defined as the rate of doing work or energy transfer, represented in SI units as W (Joules per second).                           (D) Kinetic energy is defined as the energy of motion, calculated as 0.5 * m * v² (0.5 * mass * velocity²) in SI units."
11,110年學測-自然科第18題,E,0.0,BCE,"                           correct answers: (B), (C), (E)                           Explanation:                           (B) The Principle of Superposition states that in an undisturbed sequence of rock layers, the oldest layer is at the bottom, and each layer above it is younger than the one below it.                           (C) Relative dating methods, such as the Principle of Superposition and the Principle of Cross-Cutting Relationships, help determine the relative geological age of rock layers.                           (E) Uniformitarianism is the assumption that the geological processes observed in the present have operated in the past, with similar intensities and extents."
12,110年學測-自然科第19題,B,0.0,A,                           correct answer: (A)                           Explanation: Buys Ballot's Law is more convenient for use in aviation or navigation because there are fewer meteorological observation stations at sea or in the air. This makes it easier to use the empirical law to estimate wind patterns and pressure systems in those environments.
13,110年學測-自然科第20題,B,1.0,B,"                           correct answer: (B) 35                           Explanation:                           The angle between the horizon and Polaris (the North Star) is 66.5 degrees. This angle is also known as the latitude of the observer. In this case, the sailor on the ship is observing a 35-degree angle between the horizon and Polaris. Therefore, the ship is approximately at a latitude of 35 degrees."
14,110年學測-自然科第23題,AE,1.0,AE,"                           correct answers: (A), (E)                           Explanation:                           (A) The hormone produced by the placenta is suitable for use as a pregnancy test because it is secreted by the placenta, which develops during pregnancy.                           (E) The hormone can be found in urine, making it detectable in a pregnancy test. The hormone, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), is produced during pregnancy and can be detected in urine through a pregnancy test."
15,110年學測-自然科第24題,AB,1.0,AB,"                           correct answers: (A), (B)                           Explanation:                           (A) Meristematic cells can differentiate into various functional cells, such as fibers, parenchyma, and xylem or phloem cells, depending on the plant's needs and development stage.                           (B) The cells of the root cortex meristem can develop lateral roots, allowing the plant to absorb water and nutrients from a larger area in the soil.                           (C) Although related to root growth, the apical meristem is located at the root tip, not within the root cortex meristem.                           (E) Meristematic cells may appear smaller and have smaller nuclei, but this is not a defining characteristic of them. Additionally, chromosome visibility varies during different stages of cell division.                           Therefore, choose (A), (B)"
16,110年學測-自然科第25題,BD,0.19999999999999996,AD,"                           correct answers: (A), (D)                           Explanation:                           (A) Inorganic salts can be transported via passive transport, which does not require ATP or transport proteins.                           (D) Fatty acids are also transported via passive transport, which does not require ATP or transport proteins.                           (B) Oxygen exchange involves facilitated diffusion, which does not require ATP but does involve transport proteins (hemoglobin).                           (C) Phagocytosis involves the engulfing of bacteria by leukocytes, which is an active transport process that requires ATP.                           (E) Proximal tubule cells in the kidney reabsorb glucose using secondary active transport, which involves the use of ATP-driven proton pumps.                           Therefore, choose (A), (D)"
17,110年學測-自然科第26題,AC,1.0,AC,"                           correct answers: (A), (C)                           Explanation:                           (A) Increased heart rate can lead to higher blood pressure as the heart pumps more blood per minute.                           (C) Vasoconstriction, or the narrowing of blood vessels, increases blood pressure by reducing the volume in which blood can flow, thus forcing it to push harder against the walls of the blood vessels.                           (B), (D), (E) do not directly correlate to the given blood pressure measurement of 150mmHg/100mmHg. Lower blood output per minute by the heart (B), increased sweating (D), and more intense neural and hormonal actions (E) would typically result in lower blood pressure, not the high blood pressure indicated in the question."
18,110年學測-自然科第27題,CD,0.0,AE,"                           correct answers: (A), (E)                           Explanation:                           (A) The reaction between ethylene and hydrogen produces propylene. Since the ethylene reacts completely, the number of gas molecules in the container increases after the reaction.                           (E) The balanced chemical equation for the reaction is C2H4 + 2H2 → C2H6. From the balanced equation, we can see that 1 mole of ethylene reacts with 2 moles of hydrogen to produce 1 mole of propylene. Therefore, 2 moles of propylene are produced."

(C) Synthesizing special molecules to maintain a stable internal environment is a key feature of life on Earth.                           (D) Reproduction through splitting into two individuals with the same function is a fundamental aspect of life on Earth.                           (A) and (E) are not essential characteristics for life, as they do not directly relate to the life phenomenon."
20,110年學測-自然科第30題,ACD,0.19999999999999996,ADE,"                           correct answers: (A), (D), (E)                           Explanation:                           (A) B cells and T cells are produced in the bone marrow, but T cells mature in the thymus.                           (D) Injecting vaccines into the body stimulates the production of antibodies, providing specific defense.                           (E) Not all T cells participate in cellular immunity; helper T cells do, but cytotoxic T cells and regulatory T cells do not.                           Therefore, choose (A), (D), (E)"
21,110年學測-自然科第31題,CE,0.0,ABE,"                           correct answers: (A), (B), (E)                           Explanation:                           (A) The magnetic field strength is maximum at the outer edge of the cable. This is because the magnetic field strength decreases as we move away from the central axis of the cable.                           (B) The magnetic field strength at the center of the cable is zero. This is true because the magnetic field lines are concentric circles around the central axis of the cable, and at the center, these circles are just touching, resulting in a net magnetic field of zero.                           (E) The direction of the magnetic field inside the cable can be determined using Ampere's right-hand rule. This rule states that if you point your right thumb in the direction of the current flow, your fingers will curl in the direction of the magnetic field. In a coaxial cable, this rule applies to the current flowing in the inner conductor and the return current flowing in the outer shield."
22,110年學測-自然科第32題,BD,0.19999999999999996,CD,"                           correct answers: (C), (D)                           Explanation:                           (C) When the magnet approaches the spiral tube, the magnetic field strength inside the tube will decrease due to the increased distance between the magnet and the tube.                           (D) When the magnet approaches the spiral tube, the magnetic field strength inside the tube will increase as the distance between the magnet and the tube decreases.                           (A), (B), (E) are incorrect because they describe the magnetic field direction, which does not change when the magnet approaches the spiral tube."
23,110年學測-自然科第33題,BCE,0.19999999999999996,ABC,"                           correct answers: (A), (B), (C)                           Explanation:                           (A) Fission involves the splitting of heavy atomic nuclei into smaller, lighter nuclei, releasing energy in the form of radiation and kinetic energy of the fission fragments. This energy can be harnessed for electricity generation.                           (B) Both atomic bombs and nuclear power plants utilize nuclear fission to release energy, but they have different purposes and safety measures.                           (C) Uranium-235, a common fuel in nuclear reactors, can release energy through nuclear fission, making it suitable for power generation.                           (D) Solar energy conversion typically involves capturing sunlight and converting it into electricity through photovoltaic cells or other methods, not directly converting nuclear energy into electrical energy.                           (E) The Sun loses mass over time due to nuclear fusion, not just by emitting light."
24,110年學測-自然科第36題,AE,0.19999999999999996,AD,"                           correct answers: (A), (D)                           Explanation:                           (A) Wind blowing across the surface of the water creates friction, causing surface water to move in the same direction as the wind. This is known as the Ekman transport effect.                           (D) Earth's rotation, or the Coriolis effect, influences ocean currents by causing water to move in curved paths, particularly in the upper ocean layers. This effect is responsible for the formation of gyres, which are large, circular ocean current systems."
25,110年學測-自然科第37題,C,0.0,A,"                           correct answer: (A) oxygen                           Explanation:                           The human body inhales gas from the atmosphere during breathing to obtain oxygen, which is the main component of the air we breathe. Oxygen is essential for the process of cellular respiration, where it combines with the energy released from digested food (glucose) to produce water, carbon dioxide, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the primary source of energy for the cells. Therefore, the main component of the gas inhaled by the human body during breathing is oxygen."
26,110年學測-自然科第38題,AB,0.19999999999999996,BC,"                           correct answers: (B), (C)                           Explanation:                           (B) The hypothalamus is the neural center responsible for maintaining homeostasis, including body temperature.                           (C) In a hot environment, the hypothalamus reduces blood flow to the skin surface to minimize heat loss and maintain body temperature.                           (A), (D), and (E) are incorrect because:                           (A) Adjusting ΔQ (heat transfer) is not the primary method for maintaining body temperature.                           (D) In a hot environment, the body primarily focuses on reducing heat production and loss rather than increasing thyroid hormone secretion.                           (E) Factors determining basal metabolic rate include the net amount of heat leaving the body per unit of time at rest (i.e., insulation, body size, and activity level)."

(D) Mendel did believe that each trait is controlled by a pair of genetic factors, which is the basis of his laws of inheritance.                           (E) Evidence for the laws of independent assortment comes from meiosis, where homologous chromosome pairs separate and assort independently of one another. This process demonstrates how genetic factors are inherited independently of one another."

(Beta) BrDU pairs with adenine and replaces thymine in cell DNA replication, which is a correct statement about its function.                           (Gamma) After cells are given BrDU, when they complete a round of division and then another round of division, all DNA contains only a single strand of BrDU. This statement is also correct as it describes the expected outcome of BrDU incorporation into DNA.                           Therefore, choose (B) Beta, Gamma."

(C) This statement emphasizes the importance of inherited useful traits in the adaptation of offspring to their environment, which is a key aspect of natural selection.                           (E) Endemic species can evolve in different geographical environments due to the process of allopatric speciation, where populations become separated by physical barriers and evolve independently.                           Therefore, choose (A), (C), (E)                           Option (B) is incorrect because Darwin did refer to the concept of ""pangenesis,"" which is an early theory of inheritance, though it predates Mendel's laws of inheritance. Option (D) is incorrect because advantageous traits do not arise through mutations in a limited resource environment; rather, they are inherited from the parents."

This is correct because nitrogen has five valence electrons and needs three more to achieve a stable octet. It shares one electron with each hydrogen atom and uses one lone pair to achieve stability.                           (C) In the BN structure, when it forms a structure similar to graphite, boron atoms are connected to each other, and nitrogen atoms are also connected to each other, forming a planar network of layers, with no covalent bonds between the boron and nitrogen layers. This is correct because boron and nitrogen in a boron nitride structure can form covalent bonds with other boron or nitrogen atoms, creating a network of layers similar to graphite.                           (D) When BN forms a structure similar to graphite, each nitrogen atom is bonded to 4 adjacent boron atoms, and each boron atom is bonded to 4 adjacent nitrogen atoms via covalent bonds. This is correct because in a graphite-like structure, each boron atom forms three covalent bonds with nitrogen atoms and one with a neighboring boron atom, while each nitrogen atom forms three covalent bonds with boron atoms and one with a neighboring nitrogen atom."

(C) If life on Earth does not produce PH3 under astronomical and geological conditions, then a planet without life should not produce PH3.                           (E) The presence of PH3 in the atmosphere of Venus, which is not produced by astronomical and geological phenomena, suggests that there may be unknown chemical reactions in the atmosphere of Venus."

Given that the average density (ρ) of the planet is 0.10 times that of Earth's and its radius is 10 times that of Earth's, we can write:                           M = ρ × V                           M = 0.1 × (4/3 × π × R_earth^3)                           M = 0.1 × (4/3 × π × 10^3)^3                           R = 10 × R_earth                           R = 10 × (6.371 × 10^6 m)                           R = 63.71 × 10^6 m                           Now, we can calculate the surface gravitational acceleration of the planet:                           g = GM/R^2                           g = (6.674 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) × (0.1 × (4/3 × π × 10^3)^3) / (63.71 × 10^6 m)^2                           g = 10 × Earth's surface gravitational acceleration                           Therefore, the approximate value of the planet's surface gravitational acceleration compared to Earth's surface gravitational acceleration is 10 (Option D)."

As a result, the terminal velocity v1 is greater than the initial speed v0.                           (C) After opening the parachute, the parachute's expanded area increases, leading to greater air resistance. This increased resistance slows the parachutist down, resulting in a lower terminal velocity v2 compared to v1.                           Therefore, choose (A), (C)"

The deposition of these layers is typically associated with varying water depths and flow speeds. As the water environment becomes deeper, fine-grained sediments like shale are more likely to be deposited. As the water environment becomes shallower, coarser-grained sediments like sandstone and conglomerate are more likely to be deposited due to increased water flow speed and energy. Therefore, the flow speed of the water environment in the depositional environment became slower as it became later."
