Rearranging the formula to solve for GM / Gm, we get:                           (GM / Gm) = (RE / RM)^2 * (mE / mM)                           Plugging in the values:                           (GM / Gm) = (1.86)^2 * 9.3                           (GM / Gm) = 3.4996 * 9.3                           (GM / Gm) ≈ 32.7                           Now, we can find the gravity multiple by dividing GM by Gm:                           Gravity multiple = GM / Gm ≈ 32.7 / 9.81                           Gravity multiple ≈ 3.34                           To find the percentage, multiply by 100:                           Gravity multiple (%) = 3.34 * 100                           Gravity multiple (%) ≈ 334%                           However, the options provided do not include 334%. The closest option to our calculated value is (B) 0.37, which represents the percentage (37%) of Earth's gravity experienced on Mars."

(C) Rutherford used electrons to collide with hydrogen atoms to explore atomic structure, leading to the discovery of the atomic nucleus and the development of the nuclear model of the atom.                           (E) Bohr's hydrogen atom model was constructed earlier than Rutherford's atomic model, which was a significant step in understanding atomic structure and electron orbits.                           Therefore, choose (B), (C), (E)"

Therefore, 50 liters of n-hexane can provide about 0.4 weeks of CO2 absorption for a 1-acre forest. However, this is not an answer choice, so we must choose the closest answer that represents the result in terms of days.                           (A) 0.84, (B) 2.2, (C) 6.8, (D) 14, (E) 54                           The closest answer to 0.4 weeks is (C) 6.8 days."

(D) Antacids neutralize stomach acid, which is necessary for pepsin's activity. Reducing the acidity impairs pepsin's catalytic ability.                           (B) Pepsin has its highest activity at pH=1.5 to 2.5, not pH=7.4.                           (C) The higher the temperature, the more denatured (inactivated) the enzyme becomes, so the catalytic ability of pepsin decreases with increasing temperature.                           (E) Pepsin is a protease enzyme, which breaks down proteins, not starch. It cannot break down starch into glucose."
6,111年學測-自然科第19題,B,1.0,B,"                           correct answer: (B)                           Explanation:                           During cell division, cells have a single set of chromosomes (before division). After cell division is complete, cells have two sets of chromosomes (one from each parent). The fluorescence intensity is related to the DNA content, which is directly proportional. Therefore, after cell division is complete, cells have two sets of chromosomes, and their fluorescence is weaker than during the intermediate period when DNA replication is happening (strongest fluorescence)."

(C) Skin cells during wound healing and repair are also undergoing cell division, making them appropriate for DNA content analysis to study cell division in progress.                           (A) Plant xylem cells are mature and not involved in cell division.                           (D) Mature gametes are not undergoing cell division.                           (E) Mature neurons are not undergoing cell division.                           Therefore, choose (B) and (C)."

(C) During photosynthesis, ATP is produced as a byproduct, which helps to power the endergonic reactions of the Calvin cycle.                           (E) Some plant cells can perform photosynthesis and aerobic respiration simultaneously, allowing them to produce more energy than if they were to perform each process separately."

(C) The central principle of molecular biology, which involves understanding the relationship between genes and traits, is rooted in Mendel's inheritance experiments. Mendel's laws of inheritance provide a foundation for this understanding.                           (B) is incorrect because Mendel's inheritance law is not abstract but rather a concrete concept that can be observed in his experiments.                           (D) and (E) are incorrect because Mendel's laws of independent assortment and segregation do not apply to organisms with complex chromosome structures or viruses, as these organisms do not follow the same genetic rules as Mendel's pea plants."

(C) When a cell's genes are expressed, RNA is generated through transcription, which is the first step in gene expression. The information in a gene is converted into an RNA molecule called messenger RNA (mRNA).                           (D) and (E) are incorrect because RNA from a vaccine does not enter the human genome. Instead, after being delivered into cells, the RNA from the vaccine is used as a template for the synthesis of viral proteins, which then trigger an immune response. This process does not involve integration into the human genome."

(E) Koalas and pandas are grouped into the same category because of their similar ecological habits, which indicates a closer relationship in their evolutionary history.                           The other options are incorrect because:                           (A) Chicken and humans are not grouped into the same category based on temperature regulation, as they have different physiological characteristics.                           (C) Murray cod and salmon are not grouped into the same category due to their bony structure, as they have different types of bones.                           (D) Plants and animals are not grouped into the same category because their cells have a nucleus, as this is a general characteristic of eukaryotic organisms, not a specific criterion for a natural group.                           (E) Koalas and kangaroos are not grouped into the same category because they have different ecological habits and evolutionary histories."

(D) Convergent evolution refers to similar traits evolving independently in different species due to similar environmental pressures, making it easier to identify common ancestry or similar evolutionary paths.                           (E) While not directly related to the discussion about natural selection, it is important to note that the modern understanding of genetics and evolution has expanded upon Darwin's original theory, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms driving evolution."

Andromeda is a blue-white supergiant star with a higher surface temperature than Huan Hai Er, an orange giant star.                           (B) Neptune's surface temperature is higher than Mars's surface temperature because Neptune is a gas giant with a much higher average temperature than Mars, which is a terrestrial planet.                           (C) Uranus's surface temperature is lower than Huan Hai Er's, as Uranus is an ice giant and has a colder temperature than Huan Hai Er, an orange giant star.                           (D) Andromeda's emission is not applicable in this context, as it is a star and not a celestial body with emission properties.                           (E) Mars's emission is not applicable in this context, as it is a terrestrial planet and does not emit like a celestial body such as a star.                           Therefore, choose (B) as the correct answer."
14,111年學測-自然科第32題,ADE,0.19999999999999996,ACD,"                           correct answers: (A), (C), (D)                           Explanation:                           (A) When dew forms into dewdrops in the morning, latent heat is released from the solid (dew) to liquid (dewdrops) phase transition.                           (C) When snow melts on land, latent heat is released from the solid (snow) to liquid (water) phase transition.                           (D) When water attaches to nuclei and forms ice crystals, latent heat is released from the liquid (water) to solid (ice) phase transition.                           (B) and (E) are incorrect because they do not involve phase transitions with latent heat release. In (B), the direct transition from ice to vapor requires more energy than is typically available at low temperatures in high latitude regions. In (E), the formation of cumulonimbus clouds is associated with the release of latent heat from the liquid (water) to vapor (water vapor) phase transition."

(B) is incorrect because the passage does not provide information on the direction of the Kuroshio Current in winter.                           (C) is correct as it provides information about the Japanese eel larvae season and the Kuroshio Current's average speed.                           (D) is correct as the passage states that eel larvae use the Kuroshio Current to move, and they can be caught in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and China.                           (E) is correct as pollution and ecological damage could indeed be a reason for the decrease in eel catch.                           Therefore, the statement with a significant error is (B)."
16,111年學測-自然科第36題,A,1.0,A,"                           correct answer: (A) 3:1                           Explanation:                           The salinity of the Kuroshio Current is 33‰ and the salinity of the river water is 1‰. The salinity of the water where the flatfish are located is 25‰. This indicates that the water where the flatfish are located is 32% freshwater (1‰) and 68% Kuroshio Current (33‰). Therefore, the ratio of the weight of the mixed Kuroshio Current and river water is 3:1 (68:32)."

(D) By determining the amount of solar radiation absorbed by each unit weight of black carbon particles, we can assess the extent to which black carbon affects Earth's temperature by blocking solar radiation.                           (B) and (C) are not directly related to the impact of black carbon on Earth's temperature, as the total amount of black carbon deposited in the crust and the molecular weight of carbon molecules do not directly indicate the effect on Earth's temperature.                           (E) While it is relevant to the source of black carbon emissions, it does not directly indicate the extent to which black carbon affects Earth's temperature.

(C) Completely burning in the presence of oxygen would burn both black carbon and other carbon-containing substances, making it inaccurate.                           (D) Burning completely in the presence of oxygen and passing through magnesium chloride and sodium hydroxide would also burn other carbon-containing substances, leading to inaccurate results.                           (E) Passing through hydrogen and measuring the volume of methane generated would not accurately measure the black carbon content, as other carbon-containing substances would also produce methane.                           Therefore, (B) Wash thoroughly with organic solvent and then dry and weigh is the most accurate method to determine the black carbon content in the sample, as it effectively removes other carbon-containing substances."
