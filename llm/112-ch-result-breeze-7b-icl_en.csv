When a faster planet approaches a slower one, it is said to ""attack"" or ""fault"" the slower planet.

This statement is strategically sound as it focuses on protecting key areas.                           Option 2 proposes luring the enemy to land at Taipei and then attacking them. This strategy is not feasible because it assumes the enemy would be lured into a disadvantageous position, which is not a reliable tactic in warfare.                           Therefore, choose (B) Only 1 is suitable, 2 is not."

(B) is incorrect because it mentions ""epistle style,"" which is not relevant to the description of Wang Xizhi's behavior or feelings.                           (C) is the correct answer because it describes Wang Xizhi recalling a specific conversation from the past and expressing his admiration for Li Dong, which is the main focus of the text.                           (D) is incorrect because it talks about attending official meetings and the difficulty of seeing old friends, which is not mentioned in the text."
19,112年學測-國文科第20題,B,0.0,A,"                           correct answer: (A)                           Explanation:                           (A) This sentence provides a detailed description of the general's character traits, including his gentle nature, knowledge in military affairs, and the emperor's opinion of him as ""able.""

(C) While the passage mentions the origin of betel nut in Malaysia, it does not focus on the language aspect of its name.                           (D) The passage does not discuss the negative health effects of betel nut, as mentioned by the World Health Organization."

In ""克己復禮為仁,"" it refers to the act of restraining oneself and returning to ritual, while in ""不知"" in ""師道之不復可知矣,"" it refers to the inability to understand due to the disappearance of the teachings.
