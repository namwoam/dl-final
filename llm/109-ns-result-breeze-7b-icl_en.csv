0,109年學測-自然科第1題,E,0.0,D,"                           correct answer: (D) Beta and Gamma                           Explanation:                           The order of discovery of these processes is as follows:                           Alpha: Discovered by Ernest Rutherford in 1898.                           Beta: Discovered by Paul Villard in 1899 and Antonius van den Broek in 1900, shortly after alpha particles.                           Gamma: Discovered by Antoine Henri Becquerel in 1896, before both alpha and beta particles were discovered.                           Therefore, the correct order is (D) Beta and Gamma."
1,109年學測-自然科第2題,B,0.0,A,"                           correct answer: (A) 55                           Explanation:                           The camera's initial height is 100m, and it falls freely under the influence of gravity, which has an acceleration of 10m/s². To find the speed of the camera just before it hits the ground, we can use the following kinematic equation:                           Final velocity = Initial velocity + (acceleration × time)                           In this case, the initial velocity is 0 m/s (since the camera is dropped), the acceleration is 10m/s², and the time taken is the time it takes for the camera to fall from the initial height (100m).                           Time = sqrt(2 × height ÷ acceleration) = sqrt(2 × 100 ÷ 10) = sqrt(20) seconds                           Now, we can calculate the final velocity:                           Final velocity = 0 + (10 × sqrt(20)) = 10 × sqrt(20) m/s ≈ 55 m/s                           Therefore, the instant speed of the camera just before it hits the ground would be approximately 55 m/s."
2,109年學測-自然科第6題,E,0.0,B,"                           correct answer: (B)                           Explanation:                           The mass of Alpha is approximately 1000 times that of Beta, indicating that Alpha is more massive than Beta. Since Alpha is more massive, it is more likely to be a galaxy (option B). Furthermore, the larger mass would result in a greater recessional velocity for Alpha compared to Beta (option E). However, the question asks us to choose the statement that correctly identifies Alpha and Beta as either galaxies or galaxy clusters. Since we know that Alpha is a galaxy, the correct answer is (B), which states that Alpha is a galaxy and is farther away than Beta."
3,109年學測-自然科第8題,E,1.0,E,"                           correct answer(s): (E)                           Explanation:                           Prokaryotes lack membrane-bound organelles, while eukaryotes possess them. Mitochondria are a characteristic membrane-bound organelle found in eukaryotic cells. Therefore, observing mitochondria under an electron microscope can help distinguish eukaryotes from prokaryotes. Option (E) is the correct answer."
4,109年學測-自然科第9題,C,0.0,CD,"                           correct answer: (C), (D)                           Explanation:                           (C) Paraquat is a herbicide that interferes with the electron transfer process by absorbing electrons, leading to the production of reactive oxygen species and cellular damage.                           (D) Paraquat mainly acts in the location of the electron transport chain in chloroplasts, where it disrupts the photosynthesis process and causes cellular damage.                           (A), (B), (E) are incorrect because they either contradict the known effects of paraquat or are not specific to its mechanism of action."
5,109年學測-自然科第13題,E,0.0,D,"                           correct answer: (D) Ammonium chloride (NH4Cl)                           Explanation:                           The unknown compound does not conduct electricity, dissolves in water, and the water solution does not conduct electricity either. This behavior is consistent with a salt, such as ammonium chloride (NH4Cl), which dissociates into ions in water but does not conduct electricity as a solid. Additionally, ammonium chloride does not cause a color change on phenolphthalein paper. The other options (A, B, C, E) either conduct electricity in solid form or cause a color change on phenolphthalein paper."
6,109年學測-自然科第22題,C,0.0,CD,"                           correct answer: (C), (D)                           Explanation:                           (C) Landslides are more likely to occur on rock faces with well-developed joints (cracks) because these features weaken the rock and make it more susceptible to sliding.                           (D) The stability of the rock layer and its resistance to weathering are more important factors than slope angle. While steeper slopes can increase the likelihood of landslides, a stable rock layer and strong resistance to weathering can help prevent landslides even on steep slopes."
7,109年學測-自然科第23題,D,0.0,ACD,"                           correct answers: (A), (C), (D)                           Explanation:                           (A) The magnitude of an earthquake is related to the amount of energy released, so this statement is incorrect.                           (B) To determine the location of the earthquake source, we need to consider the arrival time and speed of both P and S waves at multiple stations.                           (C) Earthquake intensity does decrease as the distance from the source increases, but it is also related to local geology, such as soil and rock type.                           (D) Soil liquefaction occurs when the shaking from an earthquake causes saturated soil to lose strength, leading to potential building collapse.                           (E) The speed of earthquake waves is related to the rigidity of the Earth's crust, but it does not directly affect ground shaking."

(C) The photoelectric effect demonstrates that light has both wave-like and particle properties.                           (E) The energy level model of hydrogen atoms can explain the observed spectral features, as it accounts for the quantization of energy levels in the atom.                           Therefore, choose (A), (C), (E)"

(C) The heartbeat rate is regulated by the autonomic nervous system and hormones, such as adrenaline and thyroid hormones.                           (E) The characteristics of heart sounds, such as intensity, timing, and duration, can provide valuable information for diagnosing heart conditions, such as valvular disorders or abnormal heart rhythms."

(D) Hormones are involved in the climbing process of cucumber vines but not in the capturing process of Venus's flytrap, as they are two distinct physiological phenomena.                           Therefore, choose (C), (D)"
11,109年學測-自然科第29題,BDE,0.6,BCDE,"                           correct answers: (B), (C), (D), (E)                           Explanation:                           (B) and (C) are correct because the contraction of the diaphragm and intercostal muscles lowers the pressure inside the chest cavity, allowing air to enter the lungs during inhalation. The relaxation of the smooth muscles in the pulmonary alveoli allows gas to enter the lungs.                           (D) is correct because gas exchange in the lungs occurs through passive diffusion, where oxygen from the air moves into the bloodstream, and carbon dioxide from the bloodstream moves into the air.                           (E) is correct because respiratory movements are regulated by both involuntary (autonomic) and voluntary (conscious) mechanisms. For example, the respiratory rate can be controlled consciously, while the contraction of the diaphragm and intercostal muscles is an involuntary action."
12,109年學測-自然科第30題,ADE,0.19999999999999996,ACE,"                           correct answers: (A), (C), (E)                           Explanation:                           (A) Localized inflammation occurs as the immune system's response to the virus.                           (C) The dengue virus can be transmitted to family members through contact with the infected person's blood or other bodily fluids.                           (E) Dendritic cells specific to the virus differentiate into plasma cells to produce antibodies, which help fight the infection.                           Option (B) is incorrect because a high fever immediately occurring after being bitten is not a direct result of the dengue virus but rather a symptom that may develop later in the disease progression."

This process removes impurities and large particles, similar to filtration.                           (E) Recrystallization: In step (5), the boiled soy milk is filtered to remove impurities. This process is similar to recrystallization, where a solution is cooled to allow impurities to precipitate out and be removed.                           The other options, (A), (B), and (D), are not relevant to the purification techniques used in the soy milk production process."

(B) Sunspot gas composition is primarily composed of ionized hydrogen and has different physical properties than the surrounding solar atmosphere, making it darker in color.                           (D) The number of sunspots follows an 11-year cycle, known as the solar cycle, during which the sunspot count increases, reaches a maximum, and then decreases back to low levels."

(C) The southwest monsoon, which is a seasonal wind pattern, influences the path of typhoons in the North Pacific by steering them towards the east or northeast.                           (D) Typhoons require warm sea surface temperatures to develop and strengthen, as the heat energy from the ocean fuels the storm.                           (B) A frontal system is a boundary between two air masses of different temperatures and humidity, and is not related to typhoons.                           (E) The pressure at the center of a typhoon is actually lower than the pressure at higher altitudes, which is why the storm continues to rotate around the core."

(C) When the northeasterly wind rises along the terrain in winter, it is less likely to be accompanied by lightning because colder air masses are more stable and less likely to create the conditions necessary for lightning formation.                           (D) Lightning can occur in any type of frontal rain system because frontal rain systems involve the interaction of different air masses, which can create the necessary conditions for lightning formation."

(C) When a neural impulse occurs, the potential on the axon will sequentially change, moving from positive to negative and back to positive again, creating the action potential.                           (E) Action potentials are specific to neurons and are not produced by other cell types, which typically use other methods to transmit electrical signals, such as ion channels.                           Therefore, choose (A), (C), (E)"

In deep sleep (also known as slow-wave sleep or delta sleep), the brain activity slows down, and the brain waves recorded are slower and have a higher amplitude. The period of these slow waves is greater than 2 seconds, which is why option (C) is correct. In other stages of sleep or when awake, the brain activity is more rapid and has different types of waves."

(E) Natural gas is combusted with oxygen, releasing chemical energy stored in its molecular bonds. This chemical energy is then converted into thermal energy, which heats the working fluid in a turbine, converting its kinetic energy into mechanical energy. Finally, an electrical generator converts the mechanical energy into electrical energy. This process minimizes energy conversion steps, reducing overall energy loss.                           (A), (B), and (C) involve multiple energy conversion steps, which can lead to increased energy loss."

(B) Fats contain carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms, but they do not contain nitrogen atoms.                           (C) Starch is a carbohydrate consisting of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms, but it does not contain nitrogen atoms and has a much lower nitrogen content than 3%.                           (D) Proteins contain carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen atoms, with nitrogen content greater than 3%. If phosphorus is present, its content is usually very low. Proteins have a molecular weight significantly higher than glucose.

(B) In space, an artificial satellite is in free-fall around the Earth, with the centripetal force required for its continuous curved path provided by gravity.                           (C) In space, the centripetal force needed for an artificial satellite to fly at a constant speed around the Earth is also provided by gravity.                           (D) In space, a satellite requires fuel to maintain its altitude and speed due to external forces such as solar radiation pressure and atmospheric drag.                           (E) In the atmosphere, making a level turn in a vertical plane at a constant speed requires more than just gravity; the centripetal force needed is a combination of gravity and the bank angle of the aircraft."

This finding significantly altered our understanding of the relationships among the three major groups of organisms and necessitated a reorganization of the classification system."
26,109年學測-自然科第58題,B,0.0,A,"                           correct answer: (A) The HCl solution is 1*10^6 M more concentrated than the NaOH solution.                           Explanation:                           Since the pH of a solution is related to the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+), we can use the pH value to determine the relative concentrations of the two solutions. A pH of 6.0 indicates that the solution is neutral, meaning that the concentrations of HCl and NaOH are equal. However, HCl is a strong acid and NaOH is a strong base, so HCl will have completely neutralized NaOH in a 1:1 ratio. Therefore, the HCl solution will be 1*10^6 M more concentrated than the NaOH solution, as the HCl has been diluted by an equal volume of NaOH, reducing its concentration by one order of magnitude."

(B) Silver ion would produce a black precipitate with sulfide ions, not a colorless-to-green change with nickel.                           (C) Copper ion would produce a blue precipitate with iodide or chloride, and when a copper piece is added to the solution, the solution changes from colorless to green due to the oxidation of copper to Cu(II) and the reduction of Cu(II) to Cu.                           (D) Lead ion would produce a white precipitate with sulfide ions, not a colorless-to-green change with nickel.                           (E) Mercury ion would not produce a color change with nickel, as it forms a metal amalgam.                           Therefore, choose (C) Copper ion."

The Moon, Jupiter, and the Milky Way Galaxy Center are all much closer to Earth than the Andromeda Galaxy. Halley's Comet and Pluto are also much closer than the Andromeda Galaxy. Therefore, X is most likely the Andromeda Galaxy Cluster."
29,109年學測-自然科第63題,C,0.0,B,"                           correct answer: (B) Temperature: 10℃, Dew point temperature: 18℃                           Explanation:                           The temperature and dew point difference is 20℃. For unsaturated air masses, the temperature will decrease by 10℃ for every 1000 meters. So, at 2000 meters (2 km), the temperature will decrease by 20℃, which is 10℃ x 2 = 20℃. The initial temperature was 30℃, so the new temperature at 2 km altitude will be 30℃ - 20℃ = 10℃.The dew point temperature will also decrease by the same rate, 6℃/km for saturated air masses. So, the dew point temperature at 2 km altitude will be 30℃ - 6℃ x 2 = 18℃. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Temperature: 10℃, Dew point temperature: 18℃."

(B) Burning oil releases a large amount of carbon dioxide, which contributes to the greenhouse effect and global warming.                           (C) Carbon dioxide can cause ocean acidification, which threatens marine life with shells and exoskeletons.                           (D) Plastic waste in the ocean can damage marine ecosystems due to high concentrations of plastic debris in slow-moving currents.                           Therefore, choose (A), (B), (C), (D)"

This signal would be emitted by a source at the center of the galaxy, where the rotation period of the galaxy is most clearly observed. The other options do not match the observed period or are not known to emit such signals."
