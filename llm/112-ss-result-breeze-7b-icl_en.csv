0,112年學測-社會科第1題,B,1,B,"                           correct answer: (B) Building an accessible environment                           Explanation:                           The netizen is concerned about the social justice issues faced by a private association, specifically regarding their heavy workloads and insufficient staffing. This issue is related to the accessibility of the environment in which the association operates, as well as the support provided by the municipal government. Therefore, the netizen is most likely to be concerned about building an accessible environment."
1,112年學測-社會科第2題,D,0,A,"                           correct answer: (A)                           Explanation:                           (A) Alpha, as the owner of the house, has the right to dispose of the property by will. In this case, he left it to his son. The will meets the legal requirements, so the inheritance dispute should be resolved according to the content of the will. The daughter's disagreement does not affect the validity of the will."
2,112年學測-社會科第3題,C,1,C,"                           correct answer: (C)                           Explanation:                           In this situation, the courtroom closure is most similar to option (C), which involves a period of counseling and the subsequent erasure of the case record. The other options do not address the court's decision to close the courtroom during A's case processing."
3,112年學測-社會科第4題,D,0,C,"                           correct answer: (C)                           Explanation:                           Without the subsidy, Aling can afford a two-room and a one-room apartment. With the 10,000 yen subsidy, her budget increases, allowing her to afford a three-room and a two-room apartment. Therefore, the rental subsidy affects her housing decision by expanding her options to include larger apartments."
4,112年學測-社會科第5題,B,1,B,"                           correct answer: (B) The exchange between East Asian countries                           Explanation:                           The question mentions that the copper coins were discovered from 7th century China and 17th century Japan in the 13-row site in northern Taiwan. These coins were found as funerary offerings, which indicate that there was exchange happening between East Asian countries during that time period. Therefore, option (B) is the correct answer as it discusses the exchange between East Asian countries."
5,112年學測-社會科第6題,B,1,B,"                           correct answer: (B)                           Explanation:                           Emperor Wu of Han adopting Kong Rong's suggestion of promoting the system of selecting officials through recommendation led to the rise of literati as the main source of officials. This is because the recommendation system allowed educated and talented individuals, often from the literati class, to be selected and promoted to official positions."
6,112年學測-社會科第7題,A,0,C,"                           correct answer: (C)                           Explanation:                           The protest most likely took place on Russian Revolution Day because it is the only option that directly relates to a protest against inequality between laborers and capitalists. US Independence Day is about freedom and democracy, but not specifically about racial inequality. Napoleon's War Memorial Day is about honoring Napoleon's military achievements, not gender inequality. Indian Independence Day is about celebrating India's freedom from British colonial rule and does not specifically address religious inequality."
7,112年學測-社會科第9題,B,0,A,"                           correct answer: (A) Many merchants died abroad.                           Explanation:                           The tombstone provides evidence that Ahmad, a Persian, died in Quanzhou (Junzhou), indicating that some Persians were living and possibly conducting business in the city during the Song and Yuan dynasties. The inscriptions on the tombstone do not provide information about intermarriage, religious conversion, or funeral rites, so options (B), (C), and (D) cannot be confirmed based on the given information."
8,112年學測-社會科第10題,D,1,D,"                           correct answer: (D) Logging and resin collection                           Explanation: The missionaries entered the ""fuzhun"" indigenous communities in the hinterland, which were more receptive to their teachings. These communities were known for their logging and resin collection activities. Trading companies, seeking to expand their business, would have supported the missionaries' efforts in these communities. Therefore, the expansion of missionary activity is most likely related to the logging and resin collection business operated by the trading companies."
9,112年學測-社會科第11題,C,1,C,"                           correct answer: (C) Implementing a policy of Japanese and Taiwanese co-education, where those who are proficient in Japanese can enter small schools.                           Explanation:                           The passage mentions that Taiwanese students no longer need to learn much Chinese and have abandoned Chinese since the second year of the decade. This implies that the Japanese colonial government aimed to replace the Chinese language with Japanese in education, which aligns with the policy of Japanese and Taiwanese co-education."
10,112年學測-社會科第12題,C,0,D,"                           correct answer: (D) Song and Ming Dynasties                           Explanation:                           During the Song and Ming Dynasties, a practice called ""putting out"" was common. Landowning families would rent their land to tenants and provide them with a small stipend. Over several generations, the landowning families became increasingly removed from direct involvement in agriculture and governance, making them unfamiliar with the world outside their estates. This practice led to the development of a migrant community that was settled for eight or nine generations, living off stipends, and owning land they did not cultivate, making them ineffective at governing their families."
11,112年學測-社會科第13題,C,1,C,"                           correct answer: (C)                           Explanation:                           The passage mentions ""Grievance only"" and references historical events such as the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895 and the Boxer Rebellion of 1900, which are related to the decline of the Chinese Empire and the desire for revenge and restoration. This context is most closely associated with the revolutionaries and their propaganda during the Eight-Nation Alliance invasion. The other options refer to different historical events and movements that do not fit the context of the passage."
12,112年學測-社會科第14題,D,0,A,"                           correct answer: (A) Adopting a lenient and tolerant attitude towards Confucian scholars                           Explanation:                           During the Yuan Dynasty, Mongolian rulers were lenient and tolerant towards Confucian scholars. They recognized the importance of Confucianism in maintaining social order and governance, and they allowed Confucian scholars to hold official positions in the government. This lenient and tolerant attitude helped to promote the spread of Confucian culture and ideas in the Yuan Dynasty."
13,112年學測-社會科第15題,D,0,C,"                           correct answer: (C)                           Explanation:                           The information provided by Alpha (Graph 1) and Beta (news report) both relate to the success of Indian soldiers in various battlefields. This suggests that the most likely question for students to explore is related to the involvement of Indian soldiers and colonies in a war effort. The best option that fits this context is (C), which discusses the recruitment of people from colonies and self-governing territories for the Allied forces in World War I."
14,112年學測-社會科第16題,C,0,A,"                           correct answer: (A)                           Explanation:                           The culture minister's statement refers to the historical context of foreign powers taking ancient statues from religious buildings, which were later deemed pagan relics by the incoming religious forces. This situation occurred during the Crusades, where soldiers took statues from tombs in the Middle East. Option (A) is the most accurate representation of this scenario, as the other options refer to different historical events and geographical locations."
15,112年學測-社會科第17題,A,0,B,"                           correct answer: (B)                           Explanation:                           The question mentions the exhibition, which implies that the theme is related to a historical figure or event. Martin Luther is the most well-known figure associated with the Protestant Reformation, which began in Germany. The other options mention other historical figures (Calvin, Adam Smith, Montesquieu) and countries (Netherlands, United Kingdom, France), but the Protestant Reformation's connection to Germany makes option (B) the most likely theme of the exhibition."
16,112年學測-社會科第19題,D,0,A,"                           correct answer: (A) China's Southeastern Coast                           Explanation:                           The mixed population in 15th to 17th century southern Malay Peninsula coastal area is likely descended from the ancestors of China's Southeastern Coast. Historical records and evidence suggest that during this period, people from China's southeastern coast, particularly Fujian and Guangdong provinces, migrated to the Malay Peninsula and married local women, maintaining their customs and festivals from their homeland."
17,112年學測-社會科第22題,C,0,B,"                           correct answer: (B)                           Explanation:                           Since the total transactions and the peak period both occurred during 1638-1639, it can be inferred that the Dutch East India Company's supply of silk to Japan remained constant or increased during this period. The fact that the profit margins on silk sales are mentioned indicates that there was a demand for silk in Japan. Therefore, it can be inferred that the Dutch East India Company's supply of silk to Japan is increasing, and the increase in demand from Japan is even greater (Option B)."
18,112年學測-社會科第23題,C,1,C,"                           correct answer: (C)                           Explanation:                           To estimate Japan's GDP in 1638, the student must have added the information about the trade balance between the East India Company and Japan, which is the difference between the amount the company sold goods to Japan and the amount it purchased from Japan. This information would help the student determine whether the trade was profitable or not, leading to a higher GDP estimate after including the trade data."
19,112年學測-社會科第24題,B,0,A,"                           correct answer: (A)                           Explanation:                           In this situation, a local government regulation contradicts a national law passed by the central government. According to the principle of hierarchy in the legal system, a lower-level regulation cannot contradict a higher-level law. Therefore, the local government's ordinance is considered invalid, making option (A) the most similar legal consideration."
20,112年學測-社會科第25題,A,1,A,"                           correct answer: (A) The price of domestic pork increases, and the quantity increases; the price of US pork decreases, and the quantity decreases.                           Explanation:                           When the central government opens up the import of American pork containing ractopamine, it introduces competition into the domestic pork market. As a result, the price of domestic pork will likely increase due to increased competition. Conversely, the price of US pork will decrease as it seeks to enter the domestic market.                           Additionally, the implementation of origin labeling will make domestic consumers more aware of the source of the pork they are purchasing. This increased awareness may lead to an increase in the quantity of domestic pork demanded, as some consumers may prefer to continue consuming locally produced pork that is not subject to ractopamine regulations.                           On the other hand, the quantity of US pork demanded may decrease as some consumers avoid pork containing ractopamine or due to the potential for fines and penalties associated with its presence.                           Therefore, the equilibrium price of domestic pork will increase, and the quantity will increase, while the equilibrium price of US pork will decrease, and the quantity will decrease."
21,112年學測-社會科第26題,D,1,D,"                           correct answer: (D)                           Explanation:                           The question asks for the reason that would most likely declare the given situation null and void. Among the options, (D) ""Conflict with the Food Safety Act passed by the Legislative Council"" is the most appropriate reason because it involves a legal conflict with an established law, making the situation null and void. The other options refer to procedural aspects or opposition, which may not necessarily render the situation null and void."
22,112年學測-社會科第27題,D,0,C,"                           correct answer: (C) the realization of the vision depends on whether people can identify with it                           Explanation:                           The question discusses the difference in public perception between digital identity cards and vaccine digital maps. The statement suggests that the success of the vaccine digital maps indicates that the policy should be more cautious in decision-making. Option (C) best fits this context, as it emphasizes the importance of people's identification and connection with the policy for its successful implementation."
23,112年學測-社會科第28題,B,1,B,"                           correct answer: (B)                           Explanation:                           (A) Both vaccine digital maps and digital identity cards can enhance citizens' rights, but they should be evaluated separately.                           (B) Vaccine digital maps enhance citizens' right to know, but digital identity cards weaken citizens' privacy. These technologies should be given different evaluations because they have different impacts on individual rights.                           (C) Vaccine digital maps weaken citizens' privacy, while digital identity cards enhance citizens' freedom of movement. This option is inconsistent with the effects of the two technologies on individual rights.                           (D) This option states that both technologies weaken citizens' freedom of movement, which is not accurate. Vaccine digital maps do not directly affect freedom of movement, and digital identity cards may enhance it by verifying vaccination status for certain activities.                           Therefore, choose (B) as the most reasonable perspective."
24,112年學測-社會科第31題,B,0,D,"                           correct answer: (D) Land-to-Labor Ratio of 375:625                           Explanation:                           The question does not provide specific information related to the other options:                           (A) Head Tax: This topic is related to immigration and racial discrimination, but it does not directly involve the information provided.                           (B) Reduce Four, Retain Six: This topic refers to the unequal Treaty Ports and customs regulations, which also does not directly involve the information provided.                           (C) Cede Territory and Exchange Water: This topic is related to the Treaty of Nanking but does not directly involve the information provided.                           (D) Land-to-Labor Ratio of 375:625: This topic is related to the economic conditions of Taiwan during the Japanese colonial period, which can be supported by the information provided about agricultural productivity and population density."
25,112年學測-社會科第32題,D,0,A,"                           correct answer: (A) Data one: Graph 5, Data two: Graph 6                           Explanation:                           The question states that the student collected three pieces of data, and the two graphs (Graph 5 and Graph 6) represent the number of Taiwanese laborers migrating. Therefore, the correct order of data collection is Data one: Graph 5, Data two: Graph 6."
26,112年學測-社會科第34題,C,0,A,"                           correct answer: (A)                           Explanation:                           The question is about the relationship between the placement of ""stone lions"" and prevailing winds in Kyushin National Park. The regional development processes mentioned in the options (B), (C), and (D) are not directly related to this relationship. Option (A) is the most suitable choice as it discusses the core growth and the beginning of reverse suction, which can be metaphorically related to the distribution of ""stone lions"" to ward off evil winds."
27,112年學測-社會科第35題,D,0,C,"                           correct answer(s): (C) Beta, Gamma, and Epsilon                           Explanation:                           In scientific investigations, data is often categorized into different types, such as qualitative (Alpha), quantitative (Beta), and unquantifiable (Gamma). In the context of a geographical investigation, the unquantifiable data (Gamma) would be most relevant, as it would include information about the area being studied, such as its history, culture, and ecosystems. Additionally, the quantitative data (Beta) would be useful for measuring and analyzing various aspects of the area, while the delta (the change in data over time) would provide insights into how the area has evolved or changed. The epsilon (the additional or irregular data) would be helpful for addressing any unexpected or unforeseen aspects of the investigation. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) Beta, Gamma, and Epsilon."
28,112年學測-社會科第36題,B,0,C,"                           correct answer: (C) The flood from the Beta River overwhelmed the settlement on a landslide slope.                           Explanation:                           The question states that heavy rains caused flooding in Germany, Belgium, and Luxembourg. The photo shows the Eider River with the Alpha River section having a higher elevation than the Beta River section. Since the flood occurred in the Beta River section, it is logical to conclude that the flood from the Beta River overwhelmed the settlement on a landslide slope."
29,112年學測-社會科第37題,A,0,D,"                           correct answer: (D) Subtropical high                           Explanation:                           The Subtropical high is responsible for the formation of large-scale precipitation events due to its role in creating areas of high pressure and convergence, which can lead to cloud formation and precipitation. The other options do not have a direct relationship with planetary-scale precipitation events. The Polar easterly jet and Polar high are associated with cold, dry conditions, and the Northeasterly monsoon is a regional monsoon pattern that does not necessarily cause large-scale precipitation events."
30,112年學測-社會科第38題,A,1,A,                           correct answer(s): (A)                           Explanation:                           (A) The main reason Taiwan's semiconductor industry is successful is its upstream and downstream manufacturers' mutually dependent relationship. This relationship allows for efficient production and innovation. Other developing countries struggle to replicate this success due to the need for high-quality technology and manpower to overcome the fine processing bottleneck in the semiconductor industry.
31,112年學測-社會科第40題,A,1,A,"                           correct answer: (A) Lack of good industrial location conditions for raw materials                           Explanation: The question mentions that other developing Asian countries cannot easily replicate the Taiwan experience in the short term. This is likely due to a lack of good industrial location conditions for raw materials, which are essential for industrial development. Taiwan's strategic location and availability of resources have contributed to its economic success, making it difficult for other countries to replicate its experience without similar conditions."
32,112年學測-社會科第41題,C,0,A,"                           correct answer: (A) Asian                           Explanation: The text does not provide specific information about the group being referred to. However, considering the context of the ""Pacific Ring of Fire"" and Taiwan's location, it is most likely referring to Asian countries and their geological features."
33,112年學測-社會科第42題,D,0,C,"                           correct answer: (C) Gamma                           Explanation:                           The question states that the ""Disaster Relief Center Shelter"" (Figure 7) was set up on a more accessible and safer site. From the information provided, we can infer that the shelter was established in a location distinct from the original community in Nanfeng Village. However, the options (A) Alpha, (B) Beta, and (C) Gamma are not explicitly mentioned in the passage. Therefore, we must choose (C) Gamma as it is the most logical option, as it is the only one provided."
34,112年學測-社會科第44題,D,1,D,"                           correct answer(s): (D) The right to traditional territories                           Explanation:                           The partnership between the tribe and the government best exemplifies the ideal of direct public participation in decision-making, which better serves the public interest. In this context, the indigenous rights that align with this partnership are the rights to traditional territories, as they directly relate to the involvement of the tribe in decision-making processes concerning their land and resources."
35,112年學測-社會科第46題,C,1,C,"                           correct answer: (C)                           Explanation: The question discusses the phenomenon of ""keyboard activism"" and its impact on people's political views and behavior in democratic countries. Option (C) directly relates to this phenomenon by mentioning the connection between internet users' political inclinations and their affinity for different political parties. Options (A), (B), and (D) are not directly related to the phenomenon discussed in the question."
36,112年學測-社會科第48題,B,0,BC,"                           correct answer(s): (B), (C)                           Explanation:                           (B) The belief in city gods reflects a hierarchical administrative system, as it shows the connection between the central government's establishment of yuanshi temples and the existing belief in city gods.                           (C) Merchants traveling between cities can pay respects at the temple during transactions, as the Zhen Yuanshi Temple serves as a central point for worship and communication between gods in a hierarchical belief circle."
37,112年學測-社會科第52題,B,1,B,"                           correct answer: (B) Encourage couples to share the responsibility of childcare                           Explanation:                           The question focuses on the low birth rate phenomenon and measures to address it.
