The sequence of events in the passage is as follows:                           1. The speaker likes reminiscing and noticing how much time has affected others (乙).                           2.

3,110年學測-國文科第4題,D,0.0,B,"                           correct answers: (B)                           Explanation:                           In the first couplet, the most suitable word to fill in the blank is ""doubt,"" as it contrasts with ""understanding.""                           In the second couplet, the most suitable word to fill in the blank is ""what,"" as it refers to the exception of poetry.                           In the third couplet, the most suitable word to fill in the blank is ""exhilaration,"" as it conveys the feeling of freedom and the positive emotions associated with the night moon and morning bell.                           Therefore, choose (B) as the most suitable option for the translated question."

This is because, in traditional Chinese culture, writing a letter is a common and respectful way to communicate with someone you respect, such as a master. The other options involve sending a banquet invitation, a birthday card, or a postcard, which are not the most appropriate ways to contact his master and fellow disciples in this context."
5,110年學測-國文科第6題,B,0.0,A,"                           correct answer: (A)                           Explanation:                           (A) is inappropriate because it describes the poet's independent nature rather than focusing on hidden meanings in modern poetry. Modern poetry often contains deeper meanings and symbolism, which is better represented by options (B), (C), and (D)."
6,110年學測-國文科第7題,C,0.0,AB,"                           correct answer(s): (A), (B)                           Explanation:                           (A) The passage describes how the person unconsciously sings their favorite song when they are in a good mood, and they sing with clear diction.                           (B) The passage also mentions that this type of singing often occurs when the person is alone, such as when they are in the bathroom or riding a motorcycle.                           (C) and (D) are not accurate because the passage does not mention that the person becomes absorbed in the melody or that they sing while closing their mouth and humming."
7,110年學測-國文科第8題,D,1.0,D,"                           correct answer: (D)                           Explanation:                           According to Kant's viewpoint, only actions driven by a sense of duty hold moral value. He believes that acting out of compassion, though commendable, does not hold moral value. Therefore, the correct answer is (D)."
8,110年學測-國文科第9題,A,1.0,A,"                           correct answer(s): (A) West Wing / East Room / North Facing                           Explanation:                           The question asks to fill in the blank in each case with a sequence of words that best fits the context of the passage. In this case, the context is related to a room or location. The only option that provides a coherent and contextually appropriate sequence of words is (A) West Wing / East Room / North Facing. The other options do not fit the context of the passages provided."
9,110年學測-國文科第10題,D,1.0,D,"                           correct answer: (D)                           Explanation:                           The passage discusses the establishment of customs and etiquette by rulers to regulate people's desires and needs, leading to order and preventing chaos. This makes option (D) the best choice to capture the main idea of the passage."
10,110年學測-國文科第11題,C,1.0,C,"                           correct answer: (C) Eloquence and Attractiveness                           Explanation:                           The passage discusses the importance of skillfully expressing oneself, appearing attractive, and knowing how to move and behave appropriately in interactions with the world. These concepts align with the idea of eloquence and attractiveness, making option (C) the most likely topic of the exam question."

(C) Zhuo and Ma discuss making a living by selling chrysanthemums, which is the main topic of their conversation in the given dialogue.                           (B) and (D) are incorrect because they either misrepresent or do not directly address the main points of the dialogue between Zhuo and Ma."
12,110年學測-國文科第13題,D,0.0,A,"                           correct answer: (A)                           Explanation:                           The question asks for the most appropriate description of the illness of stone and feather in Zhou Botiao's ""Drunken Tongbo Paintings."" Option (A) states that Zhou Botiao is obsessed with calligraphy and painting, and his illness does not change his enjoyment. This option best captures the essence of the illness of stone and feather, which symbolizes the artist's passion and devotion to their craft, even if it brings suffering. The other options either introduce unrelated characters or misrepresent the nature of the illness."
13,110年學測-國文科第14題,C,0.0,B,"                           correct answer: (B) Unique and exclusive spirit                           Explanation:                           The passage likely discusses the content and characteristics of jeans, which is best described by the ""Unique and exclusive spirit"" option. The other options do not directly relate to the content of the passage about jeans."
14,110年學測-國文科第15題,D,1.0,D,"                           correct answer: (D) New middle class / Popular recognition                           Explanation:                           The ""paradoxical"" nature of denim jeans refers to the contrast between their working-class origins and their current status as a fashionable and popular item. The concept of ""New middle class / Popular recognition"" is least suitable for explaining this paradox because it does not address the contrast between the working-class and fashionable aspects of denim jeans. The other options, such as (A) Left-wing imagery / Fashion item, (B) Proletarian / Individual rebellion, and (C) Fashion style / Casual untidiness, all touch upon the contrasting aspects of denim jeans and are more suitable for explaining the paradox."
15,110年學測-國文科第16題,B,1.0,B,"                           correct answer(s): (B)                           Explanation:                           (A) The data provided in Part A does not allow us to determine the cooking time order for different types of porridge.                           (B) The data in Part A suggests that barley and mushroom porridge preparation involves soaking and cleaning the barley and mushrooms before cooking.                           (C) The data in Part A does not mention frying ingredients with honey in the preparation of oat and mushroom porridge.                           (D) The data in Part A does not provide information on the cooking methods for barley and oat porridge.                           Therefore, choose (B) as the most appropriate statement based on the given data."

(D) Lu You's perspective on food and its impact on his health can be best reflected by the statement that he had poor health and was often troubled by digestive issues and high blood sugar levels. This is because his dietary habits, as mentioned in the question, were rich in foods that could contribute to health issues."
17,110年學測-國文科第18題,C,1.0,C,"                           correct answer: (C) Both options 1 and 2 are correct.                           Explanation:                           Su Dongpo wants to control their blood sugar. Option (A) suggests eating more rice and less solid meat, which can lead to a higher glycemic index diet and increased blood sugar levels. Option (B) suggests eating less porridge and more high-fiber vegetables, which can help stabilize blood sugar levels. Therefore, a combination of both options (C) is the most appropriate approach for Su Dongpo to control their blood sugar."

Option (A) best reflects this viewpoint by stating that these indicators help construct a one-sided description of economic development with statistical data. The other options do not accurately represent the passage's main idea or may be contradictory.

The most suitable words to describe this situation are ""vague"" or ""ambiguous,"" which are best represented by the option (C) 含糊其辭."
22,110年學測-國文科第23題,B,0.0,D,"                           correct answer: (D) Most people value things that are far away and disregard those that are close to them; they are also unaware of their own shortcomings and believe themselves to be wise.                           Explanation:                           The passage discusses the concept of distance and its influence on people's perceptions and values. Option (D) captures the main idea of the passage, which is about how people tend to value distant things more and overlook their own shortcomings. The other options do not accurately represent the main idea of the passage."
23,110年學測-國文科第24題,A,1.0,A,"                           correct answer: (A) Adapting to the times and not being bound by the value of being a dragon or a snake                           Explanation:                           The passage from ""Zhuangzi"" discusses the idea of not being bound by labels or preconceived notions, emphasizing the importance of adapting to changing circumstances. Option (A) best captures this perspective by highlighting the need to adapt to the times and not being restricted by certain identities or roles, such as a dragon or a snake."
24,110年學測-國文科第25題,A,0.0,B,"                           correct answer: (B)                           Explanation:                           In the context of the passage (Erbian, Mengzi, and Zhuangzi), ""morality"" best fits the meaning of having good morals and behaving according to reason. This is because these texts are Confucian, Daoist, and Mohist classical works that emphasize ethical and moral principles. Option (B) captures this essence, while options (A), (C), and (D) do not fully encompass the moral and ethical aspects of the original text."
25,110年學測-國文科第26題,B,1.0,B,"                           correct answer: (B)                           Explanation:                           (A) focuses on showing off the erudition of the literati, which is not the main purpose of historical topics in classical poetry.                           (C) discusses lyrical poetry based on history and biography, but the question is about classical poetry, not lyrical poetry.                           (D) is about historians' traditions, which is not directly related to the appearance of historical topics in classical poetry.                           (B) best fits the view that historical topics appear in classical poetry, as it suggests that poets often reflect on contemporary situations or their own positions through the writing of historical topics."
26,110年學測-國文科第27題,D,0.0,C,"                           correct answer: (C)                           Explanation:                           (A) The quote from Poem 乙 does not mention Yi Yin and Lu Wan, but rather focuses on the theme of humble beginnings and the importance of perseverance.                           (B) Poem 丙 focuses on the theme of impermanence and the fleeting nature of human achievements, rather than lamenting the decline of the Han and Tang dynasties.                           (C) Both poems describe historical events or sites from the past and use them to provoke reflection on contemporary issues. Poem 乙 explores the theme of impermanence through the story of the Wei and Zhou dynasties, while Poem 丙 reflects on the transience of human achievements by comparing the glory of the past with the current state of constant conflict.                           (D) Poem 乙 does not focus on imagining ancient interpersonal encounters but rather emphasizes the importance of perseverance and overcoming adversity. Poem 丙 reflects on the experiences and destinies of the people through the contemplation of past ruins and the impermanence of human achievements.                           Therefore, choose (C) as the most appropriate answer."

Option (B) accurately summarizes the content and meaning of both poems, as it mentions the themes of personal ambition with a wise ruler in poem B and the impermanence of dynasties in poem C."

Option (A) and (B) refer to specific characters and actions that are not mentioned in the texts. Option (D) describes the audience's reactions, which are not discussed in either text. Option (C) correctly states that the stage in the first text is temporary and the second text is in a luxurious theater, making it the best match for the given information."

(B) focuses on a specific scene and does not capture the overall portrayal of the performers' experiences.                           (C) best captures the narrative techniques used in both texts, as it mentions the use of dialogue to portray the personal qualities and experiences of the actors in real life.                           (D) focuses on backstage bitterness, which is not mentioned in the passages."

Options (B), (C), and (D) have incorrect sentence structures or orderings that do not align with the classical interpretation of ghosts and returning."

(B) is not inappropriate as it relates to the divide between yin and yang in life.                           (C) is not inappropriate as it relates to the longing and unfulfilled desires in people's lives.

In the first sentence, ""晙"" refers to punishment and criticism, while in the last sentence, it refers to reporting something. The other sentences have different meanings and cannot be considered as having the same meaning in Chinese."

In this case, the most appropriate word to fill in the blank is ""careful"" in option (C).
