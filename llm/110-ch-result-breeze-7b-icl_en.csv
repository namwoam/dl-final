6,110年學測-國文科第7題,B,1.0,B,"                           correct answer: (B)                           Explanation:                           (A) is a possible interpretation, but it is not the most inappropriate one.                           (B) is the most inappropriate interpretation because it focuses on the monotony of life, which is not the main theme of the poem. The poem focuses on the sorrow and crookedness of both boats and heads, rather than the monotony of life.                           (C) and (D) are also possible interpretations, but they are not as inappropriate as (B)."

(B) is not expressing a judgmental meaning like ""The so-called X is Y""; it is simply stating that any unusual scenery belongs to the speaker.                           (C) is a judgmental sentence as it describes history as recording the spirit of the nation and the mirror of the crowd.                           (D) is a judgmental sentence as it describes the sounds of various states as foreign music.                           Therefore, choose (B) as the correct option."
9,110年學測-國文科第10題,C,0.0,A,"                           correct answer: (A) using ""crow"" to imply Song Kang Wang's evilness                           Explanation:                           The poem ""Urania"" (烏鵲歌) is an allegorical expression of the tragic story of Kan Yue and He Shi.

The mention of the ""seven-jade carriage"" and the poem's focus on the family's home suggests a theme of wealth and heritage. The inscription ""Jade Belt and Dragon"" best captures this theme, as it represents wealth, power, and family tradition in Chinese culture."

(D) In ""Ran Ying Wai Shi,"" Hu Bandit is a mentor to Fan Jin, which fits the description of a Mentor (1 is essential) who teaches the protagonist or imparts knowledge.                           Option (B) is incorrect because the fisherman in ""Chu Ci"" is not a mentor but a symbolic figure. Option (C) is also incorrect because Wuxian in ""Hong Lou Meng"" is more of an antagonist than a partner."

(B) This statement is about the change in preference in the Song Dynasty Words Collection, not the Ming Dynasty.

(D) This statement provides a method to investigate the content by referring to the ""*"" notes and comparing the average number of works by each author in Meijing and Lefu Yaowords.

The other options touch on various aspects of the poem, such as the passage of time, the transience of the world, and the deepening of emotional intensity, which can be considered more appropriate interpretations of the symbolism in the poem. However, option (D) does not seem to relate to any specific symbolism or imagery in the poem, making it the most inappropriate choice."

Explanation:                           The phrase ""人禽之辨"" in the context of this passage refers to the differences between humans and animals.

It emphasizes that the value of a person (or a company) cannot be measured in the traditional way when they become a brand or gain a certain reputation. Option (B) best captures this idea, while options (A), (C), and (D) do not directly address the main point of the text."
20,110年學測-國文科第21題,D,0.0,B,"                           correct answer(s): (B)                           Explanation:                           Since the question does not provide any information or context about Alpha and Beta conclusions, it is impossible to determine which of the two conclusions is correct. Therefore, the most appropriate assessment is that neither Alpha nor Beta is correct."

The narrator mentions the mix of young and older students, the sense of tradition and responsibility in the school, and the feeling of being in the eye of a historical storm. The closest description of this atmosphere in the room is ""闈場內依稀湧動著一縷篝火的熾焰氣味,"" which means that the room has an atmosphere of solemnity and importance, similar to the atmosphere in ancient Chinese examinations."

(B) is incorrect because it does not relate to the context of ""真正"" (true or genuine) and the feelings associated with it.                           (C) is not appropriate as it discusses the character's name, which is not the focus of the passage.                           (D) is also not suitable as it does not directly address the concept of ""真正"" and the emotions associated with it.                           Therefore, the most inappropriate option is (B)."
23,110年學測-國文科第24題,B,0.0,AC,"                           correct answers: (A), (C)                           Explanation:                           (A) In the first passage, Alpha suggests raising prices to increase merchants' profits and stimulate the economy, indicating a positive attitude towards merchants.

It gives an example of a change in the text of a poem, which not only affects the smoothness and beauty of the text but also changes the meaning and emotional impact.

26,110年學測-國文科第27題,D,0.0,A,"                           Correct answer: (A)                           Explanation: The question asks about the close relationship between text and emotional expression and how changing one or two words can affect the emotional expression in a piece of writing. The passage provided by 甲 discusses this relationship in detail, using the example of Han Yu changing a line in a poem. The passage emphasizes that the choice of words can significantly impact the atmosphere and emotional expression of the text. Therefore, the correct answer is (A), as it is directly related to the topic of the question."

(B) Wang Shouzhi's focus is on genuine feelings being more important than skillful words.                           (C) Jack Lang expresses doubt about the comparison between ""monk knocks on the moonlit door"" and ""monk pushes the moonlit door,"" while Wang Shouzhi does not make a judgment on their superiority or inferiority. This statement is the least accurate based on the given texts.                           (D) Both Jack Lang and Wang Shouzhi emphasize the importance of contemplating the text and maintaining a consistent emotional tone, but they do not necessarily agree on this specific point."

(B) The main difference between animal and human language is the ability to communicate complex ideas and abstract concepts through symbolic systems, not just vocal apparatus.                           (C) The difference between human language and other animal communication systems lies in the complexity of the systems, not just grammar.                           (D) While mastering pronunciation is important in learning a new language, it doesn't define the essence of human language.                           Therefore, choose (B) as the most suitable conclusion based on the given text."
30,110年學測-國文科第31題,A,1.0,A,"                           correct answer: (A) Am I good at arguing? I have no choice.                           Explanation:                           The question asks for a sentence that best fits the context of Zeng Zao's response to Li Yi's letter.
