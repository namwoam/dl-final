Since valence electrons are in the outermost shell, X will have fewer electron shell electrons than Y, and Y's atomic radius will be greater than X's.                           (D) From the Lewis structure, XY2 has two bonding electrons, while XY has none. The difference between bonding and non-bonding electrons is two, which is twice the number of lone pair electrons in XY.                           (E) In the XY2 molecule, the electrons in the bond are shared between the two atoms, creating a polar bond. This polar bond can donate a proton (H+) to a solution, making the solution weakly acidic."

(A) Carbon dioxide (CO2) is heavier than helium and would make the clown fish sink.                           (B) Nitrogen (N2) is lighter than helium but heavier than air. It would make the clown fish float better than other options.                           (C) Neon (Ne) is heavier than helium, so it would make the clown fish sink.                           (D) Argon (Ar) is heavier than helium, so it would make the clown fish sink.                           (E) Oxygen (O2) is heavier than helium, so it would make the clown fish sink.                           Therefore, the best option is (B) Nitrogen, as it is lighter than air and would make the clown fish float up."

(B) The compressor inside the refrigerator's function is to cool down and increase the pressure of the refrigerant, which is a crucial part of the refrigeration process.                           (C) This scenario is not applicable to a refrigerator, as it is not designed to increase the room temperature.                           (D) The refrigerant is in a low-temperature, high-pressure state when it cools the food in the refrigerator, but this option does not directly describe the function of the refrigerator.                           (E) Since the refrigerant's temperature is lower than the surrounding air, it will absorb heat from the inside of the fridge and transfer it to the outside, not directly transfer its heat to the surrounding air."
13,113年學測-自然科第25題,C,0.0,B,"                           correct answer: (B) 7.2 * 10^6 J                           Explanation:                           The coefficient of performance (COP) formula is: COP = Q / W                           Where Q is the heat transferred (cooling effect) and W is the work input (electrical energy).                           Given that the input electrical energy (W) is 1.0 kW·h (1 degree of electricity), we need to find the heat transferred (Q).                           The COP of the refrigerator is given as 2.5.                           Rearranging the formula to find Q: Q = COP * W                           Q = 2.5 * 1.0 kW·h = 2.5 kW·h                           Converting kW·h to Joules: Q = 2.5 kW·h * 3600 s/h = 9.0 * 10^6 J                           Therefore, the heat transferred is 9.0 * 10^6 J.                           However, the question asks for the heat transferred for an input of 1.0 kW·h, not the COP. The question seems to be asking for the heat absorbed by the refrigerator, not the heat transferred.                           The heat absorbed by the refrigerator is the heat input (W). In this case, W = 1.0 kW·h = 9.0 * 10^6 J.                           So, the correct answer is (B) 7.2 * 10^6 J, which is half of the heat input (absorbed heat)."

(D) In a high-pressure area, the air sinks and compresses, becoming warmer and less likely to condense, reducing dew formation.                           (B) Warm air blowing over a cold sea surface will cool and dry, increasing the likelihood of dew formation.                           (C) Ground radiation cooling can cause air to cool and become more saturated, increasing dew formation.                           (E) As the air mass passes over a mountain, it cools and becomes more humid, increasing the likelihood of dew formation.                           Therefore, choose (A), (D)."

So, the time between the S-wave and P-wave arrival is 0 seconds. Since the P-wave takes 10 seconds to reach the citizens, the citizens in Taipei have 10 seconds for emergency response. Therefore, the total emergency response time is 10 seconds."

(B) Deeper water and underwater terrain can reduce tidal ranges, as seen in Keelung and Kaohsiung.                           (C) Although the open landscape and facing the Pacific Ocean may contribute to a larger tidal range in eastern coastal areas, this statement is not correct in this context.                           (D) The time of high tide in the east coast is about five hours later than in the west coast due to the Earth's rotation and the length of the coastline.                           (E) During ebb tide, seawater flows out from both the north and south ends of Taiwan Strait, which is not related to the tidal currents around Taiwan's coastline.                           Therefore, choose (A), (B), (D)"

(D) The production of solar panels does involve carbon emissions, which should be taken into account when considering the environmental impact of solar power generation.                           (B) and (C) are incorrect because (B) refers to seasonal differences in wind power generation, which is not a factor to consider when developing energy sources, and (C) suggests that Taiwan has an insufficient amount of sunlight, which is not true given its tropical climate.                           (E) is not relevant to the factors that must be considered when developing energy sources in Taiwan."
