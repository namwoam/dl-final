The closest comparison among the given options is (B) The National Language Development Act, which includes Taiwan Sign Language as part of the national languages, promoting the recognition and preservation of a minority group's language and culture."
1,113年學測-社會科第2題,A,0,D,"                           correct answer(s): (D)                           Explanation:                           According to Taiwanese law, if there is no designated heir or will, the estate is distributed to the closest relatives. In this case, Alpha's sister-in-law and godchildren would each inherit one-third of the estate."
2,113年學測-社會科第3題,B,1,B,"                           correct answer: (B)                           Explanation:                           (A) The passage does not mention anything about shortages or market fluctuations.                           (B) The passage states that coffee consumption increased, and European countries planted coffee extensively in their colonies. This implies that the supply increased more than the demand, leading to a possible decrease in market price.                           (C) Although coffee consumption increased, the passage focuses on the colonies' extensive planting, not the growth of consumption.                           (D) The passage does not mention any government intervention or price control policies.                           Therefore, choose (B) as the most likely basis for Xiaoyi's inference."
3,113年學測-社會科第4題,B,0,A,"                           correct answer: (A) Tamsui, Macau                           Explanation:                           The question refers to a Spanish official's report mentioning losses due to the Dutch. At that time, the Dutch were based in Tayouan (現台灣台南安平) and the Spanish had a trading post in Macau. Therefore, the Spanish official's suggestion to obtain a foothold at another port and drive the Dutch out implies targeting Tamsui (現台灣台北士林) and Macau."
4,113年學測-社會科第5題,D,1,D,"                           correct answer: (D)                           Explanation:                           The information provided in the question describes the living conditions and cleanliness of the city during the Song Dynasty. It mentions that houses were built close to the moat, and people threw waste into it, making the city dirty and damp. This indicates that the living conditions were poor, and public health was likely suffering.                           Option (A) focuses on the government's preoccupation with defense, which may be related to the city's conditions but is not directly inferred from the given information.                           Option (B) mentions an epidemic and disease, which could be a consequence of poor living conditions, but it is not directly supported by the information provided.                           Option (C) discusses a declining market and poor maintenance of infrastructure, which is not directly related to the information about the city's living conditions.                           Therefore, option (D) is the most reasonable inference, as it directly addresses the poor public health and high population density resulting from the described living conditions."
5,113年學測-社會科第6題,D,0,BD,"                           correct answer(s): (B), (D)                           Explanation:                           (B) The statement reflects the limitations of US military technology in dealing with the determined spirit of the North Vietnamese alliance, which was a significant factor in the failure of the Vietnam War.                           (D) The former US Defense Secretary acknowledges that the United States ignored the national independence will of the Vietnamese people, which was a major mistake in their intervention."
6,113年學測-社會科第7題,A,0,D,"                           correct answer: (D)                           Explanation:                           During the Ming dynasty, the government imposed a maritime ban, and the local area was restricted due to rampant piracy. This would have limited the movement of people and goods, leading to a stagnant population in the region despite the lack of major disasters or wars."
7,113年學測-社會科第9題,B,1,B,"                           correct answer: (B) Mountain defense gradually took over by officials                           Explanation:                           The question states that the Japanese government continued the Qing Dynasty's mountain bandit policy in Taiwan to prevent aborigines. From Table 2, we can see that the number of official Qiangwei people increased significantly, while the number of civilian Qiangwei people remained relatively stable or even decreased. This indicates that the official Qiangwei people, who were controlled by the Japanese government, played a more dominant role in mountain defense, gradually taking over from the civilian Qiangwei people."
8,113年學測-社會科第10題,A,1,A,"                           correct answer: (A) Kinmen and Berlin                           Explanation: Nixon referred to Kinmen, an offshore island of Taiwan, and Berlin, a city in Europe, as examples. Kinmen is frequently targeted by the Communist Party of China, while Berlin is a city in Europe that the US has supported as an ally."
9,113年學測-社會科第11題,B,1,B,"                           correct answer: (B) 1930s in Shanghai                           Explanation:                           The conclusion in the question is most likely to be found in a history textbook from the 1930s in Shanghai. This is because the Nationalist Party, led by Chiang Kai-shek, and the Three Principles of the People were the dominant ideology of the Republic of China during this period. The goal of establishing a world of Great Harmony and emphasizing China's responsibility reflects the nationalist and conservative political atmosphere of the time."
10,113年學測-社會科第12題,C,0,A,"                           correct answer: (A) The Three Kingdoms Corvée System                           Explanation: The policy described in the question is similar to the Chinese system of corvée labor, where people were required to work for the government without pay. In the Three Kingdoms Corvée System, land was distributed to people who were then required to pay taxes and provide goods to the government. This system was prevalent during the reigns of various Chinese emperors, including those mentioned in the question's options. However, the Three Kingdoms Corvée System is the most likely influence from a Chinese system because it directly relates to the distribution of land and the requirement to provide goods and taxes to the government."
11,113年學測-社會科第13題,A,1,A,"                           correct answer: (A) Singapore                           Explanation: The inscription mentions that the Tang people came by sea from the mainland to do business in this land. Singapore is the most likely location as it is an island and has a rich history of trade and commerce. Additionally, Singapore was under British control in the 19th century, which aligns with the mention of British intruders in the inscription."
12,113年學測-社會科第14題,C,0,D,"                           correct answer: (D) Osaka Aquarium Kaiyukan                           Explanation:                           (A) Namba is a popular shopping and entertainment district in Osaka, Japan, but it does not specifically represent East Asian culture.                           (B) Umeda is a central business district in Osaka, Japan, and while it is an important area, it does not specifically represent East Asian culture.                           (C) Shirakawa is a village in Gifu Prefecture, Japan, known for its traditional Japanese architecture. However, it is not a location that illustrates the dissemination of East Asian culture.                           (D) Osaka Aquarium Kaiyukan is a popular aquarium in Japan that showcases marine life from the Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic oceans. It is a prime example of East Asian culture's dissemination, as it attracts millions of visitors annually and promotes awareness and understanding of marine life and East Asian culture."
13,113年學測-社會科第15題,D,1,D,"                           correct answer: (D) Due to overpopulation, residents created profits through foreign trade to support their hometown's livelihood.                           Explanation:                           The poem describes Quanzhou as crowded and the mountains as barren, indicating overpopulation and limited agricultural land. The mention of the sea being vast and people making boats to explore foreign lands suggests that they engaged in foreign trade to support their hometown's livelihood. This corresponds to option (D).Options (A), (B), and (C) do not directly address the information provided in the poem."
14,113年學測-社會科第16題,D,0,A,"                           correct answer: (A) Industrial agriculture                           Explanation: Industrial agriculture typically involves large-scale, centralized production and distribution systems. The emergence of buying vegetable boxes and direct sales from local farmers promotes smaller-scale, diversified farming and reduces the reliance on large-scale industrial agriculture. This trend may hinder the development of industrial agriculture."
15,113年學測-社會科第17題,A,1,A,"                           correct answer: (A) New Taipei City Shiding District Wuzhuangpu                           Explanation: The question mentions the tea industry and the ""Taiwan Open Port"" in the 1860s, which were significant factors in the development of the tea industry in Taiwan. New Taipei City Shiding District Wuzhuangpu is a famous tea-producing area in Taiwan with a history dating back to the 1860s. This information suggests that the focus of the student's thesis is most likely on Wuzhuangpu."
16,113年學測-社會科第19題,D,0,C,"                           correct answer: (C)                           Explanation:                           The question focuses on the environmental impact of mining and logging on peatlands and the release of carbon dioxide. The given options discuss various social-economic development features. Option (C) ""They primarily adopt an export expansion economic strategy, which makes them vulnerable to international market competition and leads to fluctuating trade volumes"" is the most relevant to the topic of natural resource exploitation and its potential consequences, which the question implies. Options (A), (B), and (D) are not directly related to the environmental impact of mining and logging activities on peatlands and carbon dioxide release."
17,113年學測-社會科第22題,C,0,D,"                           correct answer: (D)                           Explanation:                           The question asks for a sufficient reason to refute the principal's views. The most relevant statement in this context is (D), which highlights the positive influence of female math and science teachers on female students pursuing careers in science. This statement directly challenges the principal's views, making it the correct answer."
18,113年學測-社會科第23題,A,1,A,"                           correct answer: (A)                           Explanation:                           The question describes COVID-19 pandemic response measures, which involve collecting and disseminating information, implementing preventive measures, and adjusting policies based on the situation. Option (A) is the most similar, as it involves publishing crime statistics and outlining the measures taken by responsible authorities, which are both related to collecting and disseminating information and adjusting policies based on the situation. The other options focus on specific topics like death penalty, food safety standards, and healthy lifestyle promotion, which are not directly related to the COVID-19 pandemic response measures."
19,113年學測-社會科第24題,D,0,B,"                           correct answer: (B)                           Explanation:                           The question asks about the legal principle involved in the Special Act for Preventing and Relieving the Severest Epidemic Influenza, which resolved legal disputes during the COVID-19 pandemic period. The answer choices are related to various legal issues, but option (B) is the most relevant as it involves the Constitutional Court's confirmation of people of the same gender being able to marry, which is related to the broader issue of public health and safety during a pandemic."
20,113年學測-社會科第25題,C,0,A,"                           correct answer: (A)                           Explanation:                           (A) When isolated residents secretly buy food from street vendors, they may contribute to increased economic activity in the form of additional spending on goods and services, which could have an impact on GDP. Options (B), (C), and (D) do not directly relate to GDP, as they do not involve additional spending or economic activity."
21,113年學測-社會科第26題,D,1,D,"                           correct answer: (D) There is a digital divide in the accessibility of technology.                           Explanation:                           The scholar's argument is likely based on the digital divide, which refers to the gap in access to information and communication technology between different socio-economic groups. In the context of rural areas, students may have limited access to stable internet connections, devices, or adequate technical support, which could negatively impact their learning quality during online teaching."
22,113年學測-社會科第27題,B,0,BC,"                           correct answer(s): (B), (C)                           Explanation:                           (B) Pepper and silver are both high-priced items, often used to display one's status. This statement is supported by the fact that the pepper container is made of silver and has an intricate design of a Roman housewife, indicating its value and importance.                           (C) Pepper can prevent food from spoiling, and placing it in a valuable container signifies its importance. This statement is supported by the fact that pepper was considered a valuable and essential spice in ancient Rome, and placing it in a silver container highlights its significance and preservation.                           (A) is incorrect because there is no evidence to suggest that a chemical reaction occurs between pepper and silver that enhances the flavor.                           (D) is incorrect because the question does not provide information about Europe's silver production or its use in making containers for various items."
23,113年學測-社會科第29題,B,0,A,"                           correct answer: (A)                           Explanation:                           The question asks which statement is true based on the average GDP per capita for the EU in 2022, which was $37,150. The options are not provided, so it is impossible to determine the correct answer without the information about the options. Please provide the options for the question."
24,113年學測-社會科第31題,A,1,A,"                           correct answer: (A) 9.8, 09/22 01:20                           Explanation:                           The question asks for the distance from the riverbank observation station to the highest water level occurrence date and time. Among the given options, only option (A) provides both the distance (9.8m) and the time (09/22 01:20), which matches the information requested in the question. The other options either lack the distance or the time, or both."
25,113年學測-社會科第32題,B,0,A,"                           correct answer: (A) ABECD                           Explanation:                           In the context of monitoring stations, the order of upstream to downstream can be understood as the order in which substances or materials travel through a river or stream. In this case, starting from the source (upstream) and moving towards the mouth (downstream), the correct arrangement of monitoring stations would be ABECD. This is because the first station (A) would be closest to the source, and each subsequent station would be progressively further downstream."
26,113年學測-社會科第33題,C,1,C,"                           correct answer: (C) Ukrainians consider the Kyivan Rus, founded in the 9th century, as the source of their historical and cultural development.                           Explanation:                           The question refers to the historical and cultural background of Ukraine. Option (C) highlights the importance of Kyivan Rus, a medieval East Slavic state, in shaping Ukrainian history and culture. This option best addresses the context provided in the question. The other options either misrepresent historical facts or do not directly relate to the question's focus on Ukraine's historical and cultural development."
27,113年學測-社會科第34題,D,0,ABC,"                           correct answers: (A), (B), (C)                           Explanation:                           (A) The national background and media ownership can influence the reporting's perspective and credibility.                           (B) Visual evidence is crucial in verifying the accuracy of a report, especially in incidents involving conflict.                           (C) Credible international media outlets are more likely to provide accurate information than less reputable sources.                           (D) While causal sequential evidence is important, it is not the primary factor in determining the truth of the information in this specific case, as the discrepancy lies between different media sources rather than within a single source."
28,113年學測-社會科第35題,B,1,B,"                           correct answer: (B)W Satellite, revisit period 4.5 days, resolution 0.3 meters.                           Explanation:                           To calculate the number of victims lying on the road, we need high-resolution satellite images. Option (B) has the highest resolution at 0.3 meters, which is suitable for identifying individual victims. Additionally, a shorter revisit period allows for more frequent image updates, which is essential for time-sensitive situations."
29,113年學測-社會科第36題,D,0,A,"                           correct answer: (A) 適用甲圖，開放進口後，消費者剩餘會增加                           Explanation:                           In the given scenario, opening up the foreign agricultural market would lead to increased competition and potentially lower prices. According to the theory of consumer surplus, this would result in an increase in consumer surplus as consumers benefit from lower prices. Therefore, option (A) is the correct answer."
30,113年學測-社會科第37題,A,0,AD,"                           correct answer(s): (A), (D)                           Explanation:                           (A) Advocating for redress for those who may have been wrongly prosecuted and convicted ensures that the judicial power can effectively monitor and balance police misconduct, leading to justice being served.                           (D) Upholding the right to assembly and demonstration is essential, even during periods of heightened law enforcement, as it allows for the expression of public opinion and ensures that individuals' rights are not violated."
31,113年學測-社會科第39題,B,0,A,"                           correct answer: (A) Limited legislative power                           Explanation:                           The passage mentions that the farmers' protests reflected an important political system problem in Taiwan at the time. Among the options, ""Limited legislative power"" is the most relevant issue, as it implies that the government may not have effectively addressed the concerns of the farmers, leading to their protests."
32,113年學測-社會科第41題,D,1,D,"                           correct answer: (D) Hindu Period → Islamic Period → British Colonial Period                           Explanation:                           The question presents three pieces of information on Indian history, which can be summarized as follows:                           Data Alpha: Ancient Indian civilization (Hindu Period) to the early 13th century (Islamic invasion and despotism).                           Data B: 17th-century Mughal Empire (Islamic influence) to the British colonial period (enlightened rule, scientific progress, and Indian independence).                           Data Gamma: Indian Dark Ages (Muslim invasions and destruction) to the 20th century (recovery and modern India).                           Based on these summaries, the historical periodization that best describes Indian history is (D) Hindu Period → Islamic Period → British Colonial Period."

Regional interdependence and unequal exchange is the most suitable topic for exploring such data, as it deals with the analysis of trade and economic relationships between regions. The other topics are more focused on broader concepts and ideas, making them less suitable for data comparison."
34,113年學測-社會科第45題,C,0,D,"                           correct answer: (D) Marseille - Suez Canal - Mumbai - Malacca - Malacca Strait                           Explanation:                           The question asks for the intermediate stops in order when not using land transit for a route between the UK and China Shanghai. The options provided are:                           (A) New York - New Orleans - Panama Canal - Nagasaki: This route is not relevant to the UK-China Shanghai route.                           (B) Cape of Good Hope - Malacca Strait - Jakarta - Manila: This route requires passing through the Cape of Good Hope, which is not the most efficient route.                           (C) Cape of Good Hope - Mumbai - Malacca - Malacca Strait: This route requires passing through the Cape of Good Hope and includes unnecessary stops in Jakarta and Manila.                           (D) Marseille - Suez Canal - Mumbai - Malacca - Malacca Strait: This route is the most efficient and direct route without using land transit, passing through Marseille, the Suez Canal, Mumbai, and the Malacca Strait."
