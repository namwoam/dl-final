(D) To maintain the club's public nature and focus on environmental protection, Mr. Wang should consider not allowing his relatives to join the club. This helps prevent any potential conflicts of interest or undue influence on the club's decisions."

In this scenario, Alpha applied to Gamma for a ruling to impose tariffs on goods imported from Beta, which suggests that Gamma is likely to be the WTO. The other options, such as the United Nations, World Bank, and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, do not primarily focus on trade disputes and tariffs between countries."
2,109年學測-社會科第3題,A,1,A,"                           correct answer: (A) Interest groups in Taiwan and public policy-making                           Explanation:                           The question mentions ""Table 1,"" but no information about Table 1 is provided. Therefore, we must rely on the given options and choose the most relevant topic for Xiaobin's report.                           (A) Interest groups in Taiwan and public policy-making is the most relevant topic, as it directly relates to the influence of interest groups on public policy-making.                           (B) Legal cases in Taiwan for the protection of disadvantaged groups focuses on legal cases rather than public policy-making.                           (C) The powers and legislative procedures of the Legislative Yuan in Taiwan is too specific and does not necessarily imply a focus on interest groups and public policy-making.                           (D) Grassroots organizations in Taiwan and judicial system reforms is also related to public policy-making, but it is less specific to interest groups and their influence on policy.                           Therefore, choose (A) Interest groups in Taiwan and public policy-making."
3,109年學測-社會科第4題,A,0,C,"                           correct answer: (C)                           Explanation:                           In present-day Taiwan, the minimum age for marriage is 18 years old for males and 16 years old for females. Since Alpha is 19 years old, he has reached the legal age to marry without parental consent. However, the question implies that Alpha's parents have arranged a marriage for him, which he wants to cancel. In Taiwan, the Civil Code states that individuals under the age of 20 cannot marry without parental consent. Therefore, the most likely response from a lawyer would be that Alpha, being under the age of 20, cannot marry another person without his parents' consent."
4,109年學測-社會科第5題,C,0,A,"                           correct answer: (A)                           Explanation:                           (A) If Gamma finds that Alpha's guilt is undeniable, Gamma should refuse to represent Alpha to protect the last line of defense for justice. This is because a defense attorney has a duty to uphold justice and represent their client to the best of their ability, even if they believe the client is guilty. Refusing to represent a guilty client protects the integrity of the justice system and ensures that the defense is robust."
5,109年學測-社會科第6題,D,0,ACD,"                           correct answer(s): (A), (C), (D)                           Explanation:                           (A) Investment expenditures refer to costs incurred by the government when they dispatch helicopters for rescue operations.                           (C) Compensation revenues refer to the fees paid by hikers for the fines, which are a form of income generated from penalties.                           (D) Fee revenues refer to the fees paid by hikers for rescue services, which is another form of income generated from the users of these services.                           Therefore, choose (A), (C), (D)"
6,109年學測-社會科第7題,A,0,B,"                           correct answer: (B)                           Explanation:                           In this question, Small New has two roles to choose from: the warrior and the archer. The warrior's combat power increases by 5 levels when played for an hour, and the archer's combat power also increases by 5 levels when played for an hour. Since Small New can switch roles freely in an hour, the production possibilities can be represented by the lines connecting the combat powers of both roles.                           When Small New gets a double-hour upgrade bonus for archers, the archer's combat power will be doubled. To show the effect of this discount on Small New's production possibilities for an hour, we need to connect the combat powers of both roles with solid lines.                           Option (B) shows the correct production possibilities with solid lines connecting the combat powers of both roles after the bonus. Therefore, the correct answer is (B)."
7,109年學測-社會科第8題,B,0,D,"                           correct answer: (D)                           Explanation:                           The question describes a nationwide public opinion survey conducted by the government to understand citizens' support for major policies and legislation. This is most similar to the idea of public policies being decided by public referendum, as mentioned in option (D). This approach allows for direct public involvement in decision-making, prevents the monopoly of elites, and is considered one of the best forms of democratic politics."
8,109年學測-社會科第10題,B,1,B,"                           correct answer: (B)                           Explanation:                           (A) Students are not aware of the new requirement at this stage, so they cannot submit a constitutional interpretation.                           (B) After receiving the demerit notice and exhausting the internal appeal process, Alpha can submit a constitutional interpretation as it implies that Alpha has tried to resolve the issue within the university's system.                           (C) At this stage, Alpha is only notified to take the make-up exam and has not yet faced the consequence of not obtaining a graduation certificate.                           (D) At this stage, Alpha cannot submit the constitutional interpretation because they have already failed to complete the swimming test and have not obtained the graduation certificate.                           Therefore, the earliest time Alpha can submit the constitutional interpretation is when (B) Alpha receives the demerit notice and exhausts the internal appeal process."
9,109年學測-社會科第11題,A,0,C,"                           correct answer: (C) Legal supremacy                           Explanation: The passage discusses the importance of respecting and upholding the law, emphasizing that it should be superior to any other individual or group interests. This indicates that the main basis of Alpha's argument is legal supremacy."
10,109年學測-社會科第12題,C,0,ABC,"                           correct answers: (A), (B), (C)                           Explanation:                           (A) The media's responsibility is to provide accurate information and not to contribute to the spread of false news.                           (B) Sensationalist reporting often prioritizes ratings over social responsibility, which can exacerbate the situation.                           (C) Bias in news reporting can lead to the dissemination of partial information, which may not accurately represent the entire situation.                           (D) This option implies that the media is effectively fulfilling its role in reporting, which contradicts the context of the question.                           Therefore, choose (A), (B), (C)"
11,109年學測-社會科第14題,B,1,B,"                           correct answer: (B)                           Explanation:                           The question mentions that Alan Turing was convicted under British law for homosexual acts, which led to the loss of his job and chemical castration. This historical context implies that the country's government, at the time, was using criminal law to deal with homosexuality, as Small Wind pointed out. However, Small Cloud expressed dissatisfaction with only one person being pardoned, indicating that there might be unresolved issues regarding past injustices. This suggests that the ruling power of the country's government is mainly based on traditional authority, as mentioned in option (B)."
12,109年學測-社會科第15題,B,1,B,"                           correct answer: (B)                           Explanation:                           (A) focuses on legislative procedures, but Xiao Yun's argument is about the fairness and justice of pardons.                           (C) introduces an apology from the national leader, which is not directly related to the fairness and justice of pardons.                           (D) discusses the protection of a specific minority group, which is not directly related to Xiao Yun's argument on pardons.                           (B) best supports Xiao Yun's argument on how pardons should be conducted by emphasizing that pardons should not be based on personal achievements and that the government should correct the unfair discrimination of the system."
13,109年學測-社會科第16題,D,1,D,"                           correct answer: (D)                           Explanation:                           (A) The question does not mention anything about the need for a written contract, and oral agreements can still be considered valid in certain situations.                           (B) Omega cannot claim property rights since Alpha and Omega had an oral agreement to share the book. However, Omega can argue that Alpha breached the agreement by selling the book without their consent.                           (C) Alpha does not have the right to sell the book without Omega's consent because they had an agreement to share the book.                           (D) Selling the book without Omega's consent violates Omega's ownership rights, as they had an agreement to share the book, and Alpha should have sought Omega's consent before selling it."
14,109年學測-社會科第17題,A,0,D,"                           correct answer: (D)                           Explanation:                           According to the expenditure method of calculating GDP, we should consider the total spending in the economy. In this case, the two books purchased in sequence cost 100 yuan (the novel) and 40 yuan (the comic book), totaling 140 yuan. When certain sold the read novel to the second-hand bookstore, they received 80 yuan, which is not part of the GDP calculation. Therefore, all transactions together increased GDP by 220 yuan, making option (D) the correct answer."
15,109年學測-社會科第19題,A,0,C,"                           correct answer: (C) Confucianism and Taoism share the same origin                           Explanation:                           The paintings depict Confucius, a prominent figure in Confucianism, and Lao Tzu, the founder of Taoism, discussing etiquette. This interaction between the two philosophers suggests a connection between Confucianism and Taoism, reflecting the idea that they share a common origin."
16,109年學測-社會科第21題,D,0,C,"                           correct answer: (C) Advances in navigation technology in the South China Sea region                           Explanation: The ""significant change"" in the South China Sea's geopolitics is most likely caused by advances in navigation technology in the South China Sea region. This allowed for increased maritime trade and interaction, leading to the expansion of trade networks and the export of Chinese products such as tea and porcelain. The other options (A, B, D) may have contributed to the changes in the region, but they are not directly related to the increased maritime trade and the ""significant change"" in geopolitics."
17,109年學測-社會科第22題,A,1,A,"                           correct answer: (A)                           Explanation:                           The description of Indian police wearing turbans and Chinese police wearing triangular bamboo hats and green uniforms suggests that the location is likely to be Hong Kong under British colonial rule, where there was a significant Chinese population. Additionally, the phrase ""catch thieves, buzz buzz!"" could be a colloquial expression in the area. This leads to the conclusion that the children are most likely children of Chinese immigrants in Hong Kong under British colonial rule."
18,109年學測-社會科第23題,A,1,A,"                           correct answer: (A) Prevent the spread of communism                           Explanation:                           The passage mentions that the land-to-rent ratio reform was part of a series of land reforms in East Asia, promoted by the United States. This context suggests that the primary purpose of the reform was to counter the spread of communism in the region, as the United States was actively involved in containing communism during the Cold War era."
19,109年學測-社會科第24題,A,1,A,"                           correct answer: (A) A: Modern sugar mills; B: Traditional sugar mills                           Explanation: The question mentions the time period from 1902 to 1933, which is the era of Japanese colonial rule in Taiwan. During this period, Taiwan's sugar industry underwent significant modernization with the introduction of modern sugar mills, primarily owned by Japanese companies. Traditional sugar mills, on the other hand, were owned by local Taiwanese. Therefore, the graph likely represents the ratio of modern (Japanese-owned) and traditional (Taiwanese-owned) sugar mills during this period."
20,109年學測-社會科第25題,B,1,B,"                           correct answer: (B)                           Explanation:                           (A) The Korean War did impact China, but it was not the main reason for the failure of the collective farming movement.                           (B) Abolishing private land ownership demotivated farmers, as they no longer had a personal stake in their work. This is the most directly related factor to the failure of the movement.                           (C) The inability to specialize and adapt might have contributed to the difficulties faced by collective farms, but it is not the most directly related factor.                           (D) The ""up to the mountains and down to the counryside"" campaign aimed to reduce population density in urban areas, but it is not directly related to the failure of the collective farming movement.                           Therefore, choose (B) as the most closely related factor to the failure of China's collective farming movement."
21,109年學測-社會科第26題,D,1,D,"                           correct answer: (D) War-time Generation                           Explanation:                           The generation that grew up during the 1920s and 1930s in Taiwan experienced state-provided wartime education and shared vocabulary related to war and military service. This generation is best described as the ""War-time Generation"" because their formative years were marked by the impact of wartime events and education."
22,109年學測-社會科第27題,B,1,B,"                           correct answer: (B) In the 1940s, to win over the United States against the Nationalist Party                           Explanation: The given editorial praises the United States as a defender of democracy and opponent of dictatorship, indicating that it was published during a period when China sought to align itself with the United States against the Nationalist Party (Chinese Nationalist Party or Kuomintang). This context is most consistent with the 1940s, when the Chinese Communist Party was attempting to gain support from the United States in their struggle against the Nationalist Party. Options (A), (C), and (D) do not align with the specific context of praising the United States in opposition to the Nationalist Party."
23,109年學測-社會科第28題,C,1,C,"                           correct answer: (C)                           Explanation:                           The Northern Wei's equal field system aimed to reorganize land management and administration, which includes rebuilding household registration and taxation. This system promoted social stability and fairness by equalizing land distribution, making it easier to manage and tax. The other options do not directly relate to the main purpose of the equal field system."
24,109年學測-社會科第31題,B,1,B,"                           correct answer: (B) The spread of printing technology                           Explanation: The satirical pamphlet in Figure 4 is a piece of printed material that circulated during the Renaissance period. The spread of printing technology during this time allowed for the mass production and distribution of such materials, enabling satirical works to reach a wider audience and become more influential in society."
25,109年學測-社會科第32題,C,0,B,"                           correct answer: (B) Beta                           Explanation:                           The question states that zone theory uses straight-line distances to delineate spatial areas. In this case, the 300-meter walking distance from the coffee shop is the range. Since the coffee shop is an important location condition, we can assume that it is located within the range. Among the options, Beta is the most likely to be within the 300-meter range because it is closer to the center of the figure than Alpha, Gamma, and Delta."
26,109年學測-社會科第33題,D,0,A,"                           correct answer: (A)                           Explanation:                           An alluvial fan is a fan-shaped deposit of sediment built up by water flowing out of a river or stream onto a flatter, lower-lying area. The cross-sectional profile of an alluvial fan typically shows a wide, flat top part and a gradually narrowing bottom part, which represents the point where the river or stream meets the flatter area. Option (A) best represents this profile, with a wide, flat top and a gradually narrowing bottom. Options (B), (C), and (D) do not have the characteristic shape of an alluvial fan."
27,109年學測-社會科第34題,D,1,D,"                           correct answer: (D) Market fluctuations and shortened product life cycles.                           Explanation:                           The strategies described in the question aim to adapt to rapidly changing market conditions and maintain a competitive edge. These strategies include just-in-time production to avoid overstocking, increasing investments in R&D and marketing for continuous innovation, and extensive promotion using media and the internet. These adaptive measures are most closely related to the factors of market fluctuations and shortened product life cycles, as they require companies to be agile and responsive to consumer demands and trends."
28,109年學測-社會科第35題,C,0,B,"                           correct answer: (B) 亞裔、原住民                           Explanation:                           According to the information provided in Table 3, the region with the highest population growth between 2010 and 2018 is the Southwest region. The Northeast region also shows a population increase, but the Southwest region has a higher number of people added.                           Focusing on the Southwest region, we can observe that the population growth is mainly driven by the addition of people of Asian and Native American origin. This is evident from the increase in the number of Asian and Native American people in the region between 2010 and 2018.                           Therefore, the most likely answer is (B) Asian and Native American populations."

Since the options are distances (0 km, 25 km, 50 km, 100 km), it is reasonable to assume that the correct answer is the point closest to the center of the map, which is 0 km. The thematic map's indicator and the industry type are not provided, so we cannot determine the exact potential; however, being closest to the center implies a higher potential than the other options."
30,109年學測-社會科第40題,B,0,BCD,"                           correct answer(s): (B), (C), (D)                           Explanation:                           (A) is not a scale because it is not labeled with a unit of measurement, such as kilometers or miles.                           (B) is a scale labeled in kilometers, which is a common unit of measurement for maps.                           (C) is a scale labeled in miles, which is another common unit of measurement for maps.                           (D) is a scale labeled in both kilometers and miles, which can be useful for comparing distances to users familiar with either unit.                           Therefore, choose (B), (C), (D)"
31,109年學測-社會科第41題,A,0,,"                           correct answer(s): Glacial landforms are not explicitly shown in Graphic 9 or Graphic 10.                           Explanation:                           The question asks for the four types of glacial landforms in Graphic 9 and Graphic 10, but neither image provides enough detail to identify specific glacial landforms. The images show mountain ranges and glaciers but do not depict the necessary information to identify alpha, beta, gamma, or delta glacial landforms."
32,109年學測-社會科第42題,A,1,A,"                           correct answer: (A) A and B                           Explanation:                           The question refers to a figure that is not provided, making it impossible to determine the exact geological development of the regions mentioned. However, it is known that global warming can lead to the melting of glaciers and ice caps, resulting in an increase in the volume of water in rivers and lakes. Regions with increasing temperatures will experience more precipitation, which can also contribute to the formation of new lakes. Therefore, based on the available information, it is reasonable to assume that regions A and B, where temperatures are rising, may experience the formation of lakes in a shorter geological development period."

Therefore, we cannot determine the climate zone of Picture 11. However, we can analyze the given information for Picture 12.                           Picture 12 shows the average temperature and rainfall per month for a certain place. The possible monthly rainfall (mm) is as follows: October 100, January 50, July 0. This information suggests a seasonal climate with a dry season in July and a wet season in October. This pattern is typical of a tropical or subtropical climate.                           Among the options (A) A, (B) B, (C) C, and (D) D, we can assume that (A) A is the city with a similar climate to Picture 11, as it is the only city in a tropical or subtropical climate zone. Cities B, C, and D have colder average temperatures, which are not consistent with the given information about Picture 12.                           Therefore, choose (A) A."

These salons played a significant role in the Enlightenment and influenced French society and politics. In contrast, Ancient Athens, 14th-century Florence, and 16th-century Rome had different cultural and intellectual contexts that do not match the description provided."

However, the answer options provided are about the ""volunteer soldiers"" and their roles in different historical periods and dynasties in Taiwan. The correct answer should be directly related to the question's context.                           Option (B) is the only one that discusses the division of labor, mentioning that volunteer soldiers were a method of war mobilization in the process of imperialization. Therefore, option (B) is the most relevant and correct answer to the question."

(B) Mountainous terrain and low agricultural productivity can create economic hardship, pushing people to seek better opportunities elsewhere.                           (C) Many bays and coastlines would actually make overseas migration less necessary.                           (D) Widespread coniferous forests could provide resources for boat building, but this would not directly lead to overseas migration.

At the same time, he brought silk and textiles from Taiwan for sale. The East India Company was a British company that played a significant role in the trade of camphor, silk, and textiles during the 18th and 19th centuries in China. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) East India Company."
46,109年學測-社會科第65題,C,0,A,"                           correct answer(s): (A) The consumer surplus for textiles in Taiwan and producer surplus                           Explanation:                           Since Zhang San traveled to Shilin to purchase camphor and planned to sell it in Zhejiang and Shanghai, the camphor market in these regions would not be directly affected by his trading activities.                           However, when Zhang San brought silk and textiles to Taiwan for sale, it would have an impact on the textile market in Taiwan. If his trading increased the supply of textiles in Taiwan, it would potentially lead to a higher producer surplus (the difference between the price received by sellers and the next highest possible price they could have received).                           The question does not provide information about the consumer surplus for camphor in Shanghai or the producer surplus for camphor in Shanghai, so we cannot determine the impact on those markets.                           Therefore, choose (A) The consumer surplus for textiles in Taiwan and producer surplus."

This is an example of ecological agriculture, which focuses on sustainable and environmentally friendly practices.                           Additionally, the question mentions that the cost of producing adzuki beans has increased due to these changes in farming methods. This suggests that the farmers have shifted from extensive agriculture, which relies on low input levels and extensive land use, to commercial agriculture, which aims to produce goods for sale and profit.                           Therefore, the relationship between ecological agriculture and other types of agriculture, as suggested by the question, is between ecological agriculture and commercial agriculture."

This improvement would increase consumer demand for the new product, shifting the demand curve upwards. At the same time, the new brand may also increase the supply of screened peas, as the new production method could lead to higher yields or efficiency. This would shift the supply curve upwards as well. However, since the improvement in quality and taste would likely have a more significant impact on consumer preferences, the former (supply) would shift more than the latter (demand)."

The Hakka people are mentioned in the context of their relationship with ""Ruo-fan"" land. Therefore, the most suitable historical context for interpreting the Wandan She example is the relationship between Hakka people and ""Ruo-fan"" land (A)."

The Seven Years' War (B) took place from 1756 to 1763, involving major European powers such as Great Britain, France, Prussia, and Russia. The Franco-Prussian War (D) happened in 1870-1871 between France and Prussia.                           The Napoleonic Wars (C) is the most likely answer, as it refers to a series of conflicts that took place between 1803 and 1815, involving Napoleon Bonaparte and his French army against various European nations. It includes the Thirty Years' War, the Seven Years' War, and the Franco-Prussian War, making it the most comprehensive answer."
