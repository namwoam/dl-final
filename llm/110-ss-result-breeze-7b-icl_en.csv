0,110年學測-社會科第1題,D,1,D,"                           correct answer: (D)                           Explanation:                           The question focuses on the most likely successful argument in a lawsuit related to gender equality. Among the options provided, (A) is about naming rights, (B) is about inheritance rights, and (C) is about religious freedom. These rights may be important, but they are not directly related to the specific context of the question, which is about unfair treatment in the workplace due to pregnancy.                           Option (D) addresses the issue of unfair dismissal from a job due to pregnancy, which is a clear violation of the right to work and gender equality. Therefore, this option is the most likely to succeed in a lawsuit related to gender equality."
1,110年學測-社會科第2題,C,0,A,"                           correct answer: (A)                           Explanation:                           The question describes a situation where students and a basketball team face a decision that affects their interests. The basketball team, recognizing that many other students were already protesting, chose not to participate in the action. This decision reflects the challenge faced in the most common form of citizen participation, which is to gather public power and support but also require strategic actions and effective communication to bring about change in government policies, as stated in option (A)."
2,110年學測-社會科第3題,D,1,D,"                           correct answer: (D)                           Explanation:                           (A) Limiting the political involvement of religious groups may not be in line with the freedom of association and could hinder democratic development.                           (B) The question does not mention the government's role in supporting associations, and increasing participation may not necessarily be achieved through subsidies and support.                           (C) Alumni associations are indeed based on shared experiences, but this fact does not disqualify them as voluntary associations.                           (D) The increasing participation rate and the focus on religious and alumni groups may indicate that citizens are becoming more engaged in associational life, which can contribute to the accumulation of social capital and improved skills in citizen participation. This option aligns with promoting democratic political development without imposing restrictions on specific types of associations."
3,110年學測-社會科第4題,D,1,D,"                           correct answer: (D)                           Explanation:                           Option (A) focuses on reporting harmful effects, not providing analytical perspectives or remedial measures.                           Option (B) provides information on voting rates but does not offer analytical perspectives or remedial measures.                           Option (C) reports the coup and travel warning but does not provide commentary on possible solutions or different perspectives.                           Option (D) covers pension reform by interviewing groups with differing stances and exploring the impact, which best illustrates the ""commentary on facts"" function of the media."
4,110年學測-社會科第5題,D,1,D,"                           correct answer: (D)                           Explanation:                           The argument emphasizes democratization in intimate relationships, which involves equal communication and free expression of one's will. This is similar to the principles applied in public affairs. Option (D) best reflects this argument by emphasizing mutual recognition of each other's independence and autonomy within a love relationship."
5,110年學測-社會科第6題,A,1,A,"                           correct answer: (A)                           Explanation:                           Option (A) Majority rule cannot adequately consider public policy quality, and improving decision-making requires dialogue and discussion. This statement aligns with the approach taken by the government and private organizations in hosting multiple citizen meetings for controversial public issues. These meetings encourage dialogue and discussion to improve decision-making and consider various perspectives."
6,110年學測-社會科第7題,C,0,CD,"                           correct answer(s): (C), (D)                           Explanation:                           (A) While polarization can contribute to the transformation of a political landscape, it is not the main reason in this context.                           (B) Public disdain for small parties could be a contributing factor, but it is not the primary reason for the transformation.                           (C) Changes in the electoral system can significantly impact the political landscape, leading to the dominance of two major parties.                           (D) Adjustments in the government system can also contribute to the transformation of the political landscape.                           Therefore, choose (C) and (D) as the correct options."
7,110年學測-社會科第9題,B,0,CD,"                           correct answer: (C), (D)                           Explanation:                           (C) The Fair Trade Law prohibits the same store from selling the same goods at different prices without a reasonable explanation. In this case, A found another customer received an 8-discount, which indicates a potential violation of the Fair Trade Law.                           (D) If the consumer officer receives a complaint, they will investigate whether the store violates the principle of equality and decide on a penalty. This option is relevant because it outlines the potential course of action taken by the consumer officer upon receiving a complaint."
8,110年學測-社會科第10題,A,0,B,"                           correct answer: (B)                           Explanation:                           (A) The principle of proportionality requires that the means used to achieve a goal must be appropriate and not excessive in relation to the desired goal. In this case, the measures taken by the management agency (fines and prohibition of entry) seem appropriate to address the issue of visitors lying down and causing inconvenience to others.                           (B) The management agency has the authority to maintain order and safety in the scenic spot, and it can issue rules and regulations to achieve this goal. The notice is based on its management authority and does not need separate legal authorization.                           (C) If the measures taken in the notice have legal authorization, they can meet the requirements of the rule of law. However, this option is not directly related to the question about the correctness of the statements.                           (D) The Constitution generally protects freedom and rights, but the management agency's notice aims to maintain order and safety for all visitors, which is a legitimate goal. Lying down on benches and walkways and interfering with others' freedom is not a right protected by the Constitution.                           Therefore, choose (B) as the correct answer."
9,110年學測-社會科第11題,C,0,B,"                           correct answer: (B)                           Explanation:                           In this situation, Alpha is facing an issue with environmental protection officers and their fine for his vehicle's exhaust emissions not meeting standards. This is a matter related to administrative authorities and their decisions, which falls under administrative litigation. Therefore, Alpha should bring a lawsuit against the administrative authorities in the administrative court (option B). The other options involve higher-level courts or government bodies, which are not the appropriate avenues for addressing this specific issue."
10,110年學測-社會科第17題,B,0,AD,"                           correct answer(s): (A), (D)                           Explanation:                           (A) If the initial number of water pollution permits is too low, manufacturers may struggle to meet their emission limits, leading to a decline in permit prices.                           (D) If the number of manufacturers that can make a profit by selling pollution permits is too small, it may lead to an oversupply of permits, causing their prices to decline."
11,110年學測-社會科第19題,B,1,B,"                           correct answer: (B)                           Explanation:                           The primary purpose of the Tang Dynasty's revision of the ""Clan Register"" and the issuance of the ""Anti-Marriage Decree"" was to prevent traditional aristocrats from using marriage alliances to suppress their social status. This action ensured that opportunities for officialdom and advancement were more accessible to those outside of the aristocratic families."
12,110年學測-社會科第21題,C,1,C,"                           correct answer: (C) Gansu                           Explanation: The cave is most likely located in Gansu, as it is near the Silk Road, a historical trade route that connected China with Central Asia and the Middle East. Many foreign scholars and travelers passed through this region, making it likely that they would have discovered and collected artifacts from the cave."
13,110年學測-社會科第22題,D,0,B,"                           correct answer: (B) serving as Taiwan Special Volunteer Corps                           Explanation:                           Between May 1943 and July 1944, Japan and the Governorate of Taiwan mobilized and organized over two thousand Taiwanese youth for various tasks in New Guinea, the Philippines, and Indonesia. These Taiwanese youth most likely were serving as the Taiwan Special Volunteer Corps, which was a group of Taiwanese soldiers who fought alongside the Japanese during World War II. This corps was formed to strengthen Japan's military presence in the Pacific region and to encourage loyalty from the Taiwanese people."
14,110年學測-社會科第23題,C,0,B,"                           correct answer: (B) Promote comprehensive Westernization                           Explanation: The titles of the books mentioned, such as《Ship with Sails Illustrated》,《Gun Powder Techniques Illustrated》, and《The Method of European Cannon》, indicate that the scholars were studying and adopting advanced military technologies from the West. This situation most likely reflects a desire to promote comprehensive Westernization, as it demonstrates an interest in learning and adopting advanced techniques from other cultures to strengthen one's own capabilities."
15,110年學測-社會科第24題,D,0,A,"                           correct answer: (A)                           Explanation:                           The situation described in the question is most similar to the events that occurred after Emperor Taizong of the Tang Dynasty led campaigns to places like Goguryeo. Following these campaigns, the dynasty faced financial shortages due to high military expenditure. However, the emperor decided to reduce taxes to give the people a break and help the economy recover after the chaos. This is because Emperor Taizong was known for his benevolent policies and concern for the welfare of his people. The other options do not fit the situation as well:                           (B) Emperor Songzong's decision to sign a treaty with the Jin Dynasty focused on ending military conflict and stabilizing the border, not tax reduction or economic recovery.                           (C) The Yongle Project under Emperor Wuzong of the Ming Dynasty was a large-scale infrastructure and cultural initiative, not a tax reduction policy.                           (D) The suppression of the Three Princes' Rebellion by Emperor Shenzong of the Qing Dynasty involved restoring order and stability, but it does not directly relate to the specific situation of tax reduction after military expenditure."
16,110年學測-社會科第25題,B,0,A,"                           correct answer: (A) 1651: Britain enacted the Navigation Act, blocking Dutch trade activities.                           Explanation: The question asks about a country attempting to force another country to submit and protect its own economic development by prohibiting all goods from the latter country from disembarking in Europe. In this case, Britain enacted the Navigation Act in 1651 to block Dutch trade activities, which aligns with the question's context. The other options involve blockades but do not specifically target economic development or prohibit goods from disembarking in Europe."
17,110年學測-社會科第26題,C,1,C,"                           correct answer: (C)                           Explanation:                           (A) While the PLA's resources might have been limited, it does not directly explain why they canceled the attack on Kinmen.                           (B) The PLA's primary goal was to capture Kinmen, and avoiding battle would not help them achieve this.                           (C) The outbreak of the Korean War and the involvement of the United States in Taiwan's defense would deter the PLA from launching further attacks on Kinmen, as they would face a stronger opposition.                           (D) Martial law and psychological warfare do not directly explain the cancellation of the attack on Kinmen."
18,110年學測-社會科第27題,A,1,A,"                           correct answer: (A) porcelain making in Jiangxi                           Explanation:                           The description provided in the question matches the historical context of the Jingdezhen porcelain industry in Jiangxi. Jingdezhen has been a major center for porcelain production since the Kublai Khan era in the 13th century. The industry was well-developed and highly regarded, supplying products not only throughout China but also to the world. The French missionary would have observed the intricate process of porcelain making, which Europeans later replicated successfully."
19,110年學測-社會科第28題,A,1,A,"                           correct answer: (A) Guangzhou Merchant Guild                           Explanation: The question describes a ""code of conduct"" for regulating trade and prices among merchants, which was a common practice in ancient Chinese cities like Guangzhou, where foreign merchants were allowed to trade. Guangzhou was a major port for foreign trade during the Qing Dynasty, and the Guangzhou Merchant Guild would have been responsible for regulating trade and maintaining order in the market. Therefore, the Guangzhou Merchant Guild is the most likely group to have formulated this document."
20,110年學測-社會科第30題,A,1,A,"                           correct answer: (A) The Hanseatic League, dominated by German merchants,                           Explanation: The description provided in the question matches the historical background of the Hanseatic League, a commercial group dominated by German merchants that formed in the 13th century and traded in the North Sea, Baltic Sea, and along major rivers such as the Thames, Rhine, and Loire. They also had a military force and established administrative institutions in many places. The other options, (B), (C), and (D), do not fit the description provided in the question."
21,110年學測-社會科第31題,A,1,A,"                           correct answer: (A) the Han Dynasty, which valued Confucianism                           Explanation:                           The Han Dynasty was known for its emphasis on Confucianism, which promoted filial piety and respect for tradition. The policy described in the question, which aimed to weaken the royal nobles and strengthen the capital, would align with the more centralized power structure and focus on Confucian values in the Han Dynasty. The Eastern Jin Dynasty, Tang Dynasty, and Song Dynasty each had their own unique challenges and priorities, making it less likely that this specific policy would have been pursued in those dynasties."
22,110年學測-社會科第32題,A,0,C,"                           correct answer: (C)                           Explanation:                           (A) Jesuits who came to China in the 16th century to preach and began to understand Chinese culture, but they would not have described Chinese characters as ""vertically written.""                           (B) The Manchu royal family who ruled China in the 17th century and experienced the daily life of Beijing, but they would not have described Chinese characters as ""vertically written"" or mentioned Vietnamese envoys.                           (C) Vietnamese envoys who came to China in the 18th century to pay tribute and explored the Chinese customs and way of life, which matches the description of Chinese characters, the use of tea, and the mention of neighboring nations.                           (D) British merchants who came to China in the 19th century to do business and saw strange and unique things, but they would not have described Chinese characters as ""vertically written.""                           Therefore, choose (C)."
23,110年學測-社會科第33題,C,0,D,"                           correct answer: (D) Delta                           Explanation:                           The question describes a system that tracks the location of individuals under home quarantine using their phone data. This system relies on geospatial technologies to monitor movement and enforce quarantine restrictions. The most appropriate geospatial technology in this context is the Global Positioning System (GPS), which is part of the Delta project by the United States Department of Defense. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Delta."
24,110年學測-社會科第34題,D,0,C,"                           correct answer: (C) Energy                           Explanation:                           Taiwan CPC established its petrochemical plants domestically in areas with abundant energy resources, such as oil tanker dedicated wharves in Kaohsiung, Taichung, and New Taipei City. These locations facilitate the transportation of imported crude oil for processing into various petrochemical products. The proximity to these energy sources allows for efficient production and distribution of the final products."
25,110年學測-社會科第35題,B,0,D,"                           correct answer: (D) Expand childcare-friendly environments.                           Explanation:                           The question focuses on the employment of elderly people in the country. Increasing the birthrate, extending compulsory education, and foreign immigration do not directly address the issue of elderly employment. Expanding childcare-friendly environments, however, can help accommodate the needs of working elderly people who have grandchildren to take care of."
26,110年學測-社會科第37題,A,0,B,"                           correct answer: (B)                           Explanation:                           The sediment concentration in a river generally decreases downstream due to the dilution effect as water volume increases. Option (B) states that the average annual precipitation in the middle and lower reaches is less than that in the upper reaches, which is consistent with the decrease in sediment concentration downstream. Options (A), (C), and (D) do not directly relate to the difference in sediment concentration between the upper, middle, and lower reaches of the river."
27,110年學測-社會科第38題,D,1,D,"                           correct answer: (D) Urban Planning Residential Zone                           Explanation:                           The question mentions that a section of the Shuangliao River was straightened, causing a change in the right-bank area. This indicates that the area has undergone urban planning and development, which is most closely related to a residential zone. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Urban Planning Residential Zone."
28,110年學測-社會科第39題,D,0,BCD,"                           correct answers: (B), (C), (D)                           Explanation:                           (B) When a river is diverted, its natural flow path is altered, causing the erosion baseline to shift.                           (C) As the river's flow is redirected, the amount of sediment deposition may increase due to changes in water velocity and sediment transport capacity.                           (D) The erosive power of the river may increase as it adjusts to the new path, seeking to erode and remove material to establish a new channel."
29,110年學測-社會科第40題,B,0,A,"                           correct answer: (A)                           Explanation:                           The question does not provide specific information about the climate zones or regions in the country. However, since the question asks for the region that has been developing aquaculture by tapping into deep groundwater, we can infer that this region is (A) because it is the only option that mentions aquaculture. The high salt content from the deep groundwater is endangering local cattle farming in this region."
30,110年學測-社會科第41題,B,0,A,"                           correct answer(s): (A) Kuroshio                           Explanation:                           The question asks about the ocean current that most closely resembles the temperature and properties of the ocean current flowing through the country's western waters. The Kuroshio current is the most suitable option among the given choices, as it is a warm-current system that flows along the western coasts of countries like Japan, Taiwan, and China. The other options, such as the Humboldt Current, Gulf Stream, and North Atlantic Current, do not match the description provided in the question.                           For the second part of the question, it asks about the population factor undergoing rapid change. The correct answer is (C) Increased immigration, as it directly relates to the movement of people into a country, which can influence population growth. The other options, (A) Lower birth rate and (B) Lower death rate, refer to factors that can affect population growth but are not directly related to the movement of people. (D) Increased emigration is not the correct answer because it refers to people leaving the country, which would have a negative impact on population growth."
31,110年學測-社會科第45題,C,1,C,"                           correct answer: (C)                           Explanation:                           The passage implies that Major League Baseball teams' attractiveness is related to their location in large cities, which typically have a higher GDP. This economic factor may attract players to join these teams, as it indicates a higher potential for earnings and sponsorships. Options (A), (B), and (D) do not directly relate to the attractiveness of joining Major League Baseball teams."
32,110年學測-社會科第46題,C,1,C,"                           correct answer: (C)                           Explanation:                           (C) The issue of intellectual property rights on anti-AIDS drugs, held by international pharmaceutical companies, leads to high drug prices that many patients cannot afford. This situation reduces the number of transactions in the market and affects public health, especially in developing countries. Therefore, the government intervenes to address this issue and make the drugs more accessible to patients."
33,110年學測-社會科第47題,D,0,A,                           correct answer: (A)                           Explanation:                           The question discusses the high prevalence of the disease among adults and high mortality rate.

The Malacca Strait is the most likely route, as it connects the Indian Ocean to the Pacific Ocean, passing through the Strait of Malacca, which was historically significant for maritime trade. The other options, such as the English Channel, Panama Canal, and Suez Canal, do not fit the context of the passage as well."

The question discusses the banning of songs during the martial law period in Taiwan. Option (A) is correct because the prohibition orders were indeed based on government laws and administrative regulations, which aligns with the rule of law.

(C) High temperatures and humidity can also affect the butterfly population, as they may become less active or even die due to heat stress.                           The organizer is most concerned about rainy and excessively hot weather situations, as they can negatively impact the butterfly population and the overall success of the festival."
